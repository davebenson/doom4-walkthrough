# Doom 4 Walkthrough

# Introduction and Game Mechanics

## Overview

## Basic Plot Summary

## Weapon Use Summary

### Pistol
To state the obvious, what the Pistol lacks in power it makes up for by having unlimited ammo.

The lack of power can be an advantage if you are trying to stun a demon in order to Glory Kill it, if you are trying to extract more stuff from the kill.

My upgrade strategy: save the upgrades for the end, or maybe induldge in the first 1 point upgrade.
There are more important ways to spend one's upgrade points.

### Shotgun (available Mission 0)
### Plasma Gun (available Mission 2)
### Assault Rifle (available Mission 2)
### Super Shotgun (available Mission ???)
### Chain Gun (available Mission 6)
### Gauss Cannon (available Mission 5)
### BFG (available Mission ???)

# Mission 0:  Pre-UAC

At the beginning of the game, you wake up chained to an operating table
As you break out of your bonds, four demons surround you, your first encounter with *The Possessed*.

Before you have control, you kill one by hand, and grab a piston.

Shoot the remaining three.

Interact with the screen (to the right of the door) and
proceed into the central room with the Praetor Suit.  Interact with it, and
meet Dr Hayden.

### Fight: Mission 0: Glory Kill Tutorial

You will come upon a staggered The Possessed.
After killing it, kill the remaining 4 weaklings.

### Fight: Mission 0: Blue Elevator Chamber

You exit the anteroom to see 8? The Possessed worshipping an Orb.  You can Glory Kill them if you need health or kill them en masse by shooting the barrel.

After destroying the Orb, about 15? Imps will gradually materialize.
Keep moving!
There are two sheltered areas:  the entrance area,
and a control-room overlooking the main chamber.

Grab all stray stuff before entering the elevator *Checkpoint*.

# Mission 1:  UAC

The mission starts with you exciting an elevator, and dropping onto a lower plane.  3 small armor pieces are there; proceed upward to find a Info Entry: ???

As you approach another tall cliff, you can see Imps running off into the horizon: these can be shot but it's not worth the effort.  You can also shoot The Possesseds below, but it's better to use them as walking health bonuses.

### Mission 1, Fight Pre-Blue-Keycard

This is the first real fight of the game.  It occurs on a 2-level dual-figure-eight structure.

To start, kill the possessed soldier at position A, and then shoot barrel B.  But from there, you'll just have to run and shoot for a while.

## Mission 1: Keycard and Secret

After the demonic threat is neutralized, a gate opens up, opposite the enterance location.
However, another gate immediately blocks progress.  Turn right and walk down a tunnel.  Behind a large block is a corpse with a Blue Keycard.

After getting the keycard, stand on the block and look around for a tunnel above you.  You should jump to it, and pick up the Model ???.

Continuing through the tunnel, you'll get to the gate, which will open.

You'll get some ammo, but more importantly, the Frag Grenade, which is very useful, especially once upgraded.

## Mission 1:  Fight: Stray Possessed and Imps

...

After killing those guys, enter the cave to the right (at the top of the incline).  You will find some worshipping Possessed and an Auto-map.  Continue out the cave to find a Praetor Token (an Elite Guard corpse) on the right before jumping down.

## Mission 1:  Fight: Stray Imps

As you drop down the last level of this spit of land, 4 Imps will attack from various directions.

After that, look for the large tank with TRI 9-C printed on it, and enter its lower level... there is a lever through that you should interact with then enter the Classic Doom Level.

## Mission 1: Fight: Classic Doom Level

There are 4 Possessed Soldiers standing on pedestals in here.
I usually use a Frag Grenade to kill the left one, then snipe the right one from just under the pillar.  The remaining two can be taken out one-at-a-time.

If you actuate the switch nearer the entrance, you can get some minor booty.
Mostly, this fight isn't worth the effort.

After this, jump onto the crates at the end of the landing bay, and jump the chasm.

## Mission 1: Across the Chasm

## Mission 1: Fight: Pre Entranceway Area

## Mission 1: Fight: Entrance

# Mission 2:  Resource Operations
## Mission 2:  Fight:  Tiny fight before opening hatch
## Mission 2:  Fight:  Tiny fight in catwalk area with Original Doom Level
## Mission 2:  Fight:  U-shaped catwalk area
## Mission 2:  Fight:  Industrial Train Depot
## Mission 2:  Getting the yellow keycard
Cross the train-tracks on the far-side of the room from your entrance.  You will see a gas canister across the tracks.  Turn left and carefully go through the hatch which automatically opens and closes.  It is an elevator.  When the door opens on the upper level, there should be a large armor.  Take it and go forward.  There should be a train on the left leading back to the Industrial Train Depot, and on the right is a Security Station.

Drop drop and take out the few The Possesseds.

## Mission 2:  Fight: Tiny fight in front of Security Station
A few The Possesseds.

Since you don't have the Yellow Keycard yet, you will have to go down the hall
to a developed outdoor area.

## Mission 2:  Fight: Developed Outdoor Gore Nest
Before destroying the gore nest, take out the 6? The Possesseds possibly using Glory Kills to get more health.  I tend to use the pistol to save ammo.

After destroying the Gore Nest, a large number of Imps and Possessed Soldiers appear, keep moving and shoot the barrels to kill some of them while saving ammo.  Make note of the two supply caches containing ammo+health before starting.

## Mission 2:  Getting the yellow keycard (continued)

On the lower level, Call the Elevator and see a replayed cut-scene of the demon carrying the Yellow Keycard guard.  Enter the elevator and press the button.

On a catwalk area you'll find some health, a field drone, shotgun ammo and the corpse of the Yellow Keycard guard.  I recommend waiting to use the field drone until you have the Plasma Rifle.  Take the Yellow Keycard and watch out!

Go through the hatch then drop down into the Industrial Train Depot, right in front of a Yellow Keycard Door.

But, don't go there yet!  Instead, retrace your earlier steps to the Security Station which you can now access!  Take the supplies and ??? unlock the doors

Continue re-tracing your steps.  In the hallway, on the floor to the right, is a Hatch.  Open it and drop down to find some The Possesseds and 2 Imps, along with an Elite Guard and a Plasma Rifle.  To get out of this area, you'll find a Grate that you can kick open.

This will drop you into the location of the Developed Outdoor area fight, which is now vacant, but some Health may have re-appeared.

Continue retracing your steps by pressing the Call Elevator button on the lower level, and find the Field Drone.  I recommend using it to get the Heat Blast modification for the Plasma Gun.

Continue retracing until you are in the Industrial Train Depot.

Go through the Yellow Keycard door, and Open the Airlock from the control room in this area.  You'll find an Assault Rifle here.

Enter the Airlock, then Cycle it to access the red outdoors.

## Mission 2:  Fight:  Outdoor Fight
This sprawling fight occurs mostly in the lower level of a two-level area.  It's mostly Possessed Soldiers and Imps- lot's of them.  I recommend running through using Heat Blast, and using the Chainsaw on the Shielded Soldier.  Then grab the Beserk Powerup to kill the majority of the remainder.

## Mission 2:  Accessing the Secret after the Outdoor Fight

## Mission 2:  Realigning the ???

## Mission 2:  Fight: Tiny fight after realignment
3 Imps climb up; one more on bridge.

## Mission 2:  Crossing the bridge.
...

## Mission 2:  Fight: Entranceway

## Mission 2:  Fight: Control Room Area
Three Imps and a few The Possesseds.
 
## Mission 2:  Fight: Hallway
Many The Possesseds, 3 Possessed Soldiers, and one Shielded Soldier.

Access the secret by going left - often the Shielded Soldier guards this area.

After climbing, an Imp will spawn in front of you.  There is an Elite Guard and a Munitions Crate.


## Mission 2:  VEGA Console area
This is a semicircular area with a central room.

But first, climb the crates at left and jump to find a Doll (a Secret).

Enter the central room and watch the cut scene.
I recommend directing the Argent Energy toward your Health.

# Mission 3:  Foundry

This mission has 4 Gore Nests you need to destroy.
The first two can be destroyed at any time.
The third requires a Yellow Keycard and the fourth requires a Blue Keycard.

Here's a quick description of each Gore Nest:
* Gore Nest 1:  In the area behind the Field Drone
* Gore Nest 2:  In the main area on a damaged platform.
* Gore Nest 3:  Accessed by the Yellow Keycard, in a side-foundry.
* Gore Nest 4:  Accessed by the Blue Keycard, in a locker room area.

The Main Foundry Area is the large open area with molten metal floors and platform-walkways.

## Mission 3:  Gore Nest 1
From the entrance area, exit into the Main Foundry Area.
Jump left over a gap in the catwalk.  To the right is a Possessed Soldier you can Death-From-Above Glory Kill (as needed for the combat challenge) and many possessed you can kill with one barrel (another Combar Challenge).

Go back, though, through the door and find a Field Drone.
Use it as you wish (I tend to like Assault Rifle's Tactical Scope).

Keep going back past some firey doors to a control console.  You can try to unlock the door (you don't have access) or watch a replay to see where the Yellow Keycard Guard has gone.

If you turn so we are facing away from the control console, there are two passages: the entrance on the right, and the left passage has the keycard.

If you enter that passage, you'll see that the catwalk has broken, and you should see a guard on the other side.

If you try to jump across, you'll land on a platform below.  To your right is a small room with an Elite Guard.

Follow the green light to jump around and get up to a platform at the same height as you started.  The highest platform should say MIXON.  Look around at you should see a square opening you can jump into:  this is a SECRET, there is some armor here.

Finally, jump to the platform you could see from across the gap.  Interact with the corpse to grab his biometric ID (ie his arm).  You can jump the gap easily in this direction.  The flaming door ahead is where the Gore's Nest is located.

Go to the control console and use the dude's arm.  Turn left twice to find the Gore's Nest.

## Mission 3: Fight: Gore Nest 1

## Mission 3: Gore Nest 2
This gore nest is the only one in the Foundry's Main Area.

## Mission 3: Fight: Prefight for Gore Nest 2
A good place to use the heat blast, and a fine place to work on the Curb Stomp combat challenge.  This is a mix of The Possessed, Possessed Soldiers, Imps.

## Mission 3: Fight: Gore Nest 2
As suggested by the gas tank, you may wish to use chainsaw here since you might be low on ammo.  Otherwise, just use a mix of weapons; I often mostly use Heat Blast here.  This is a mix of Possessed Soldiers, Imps, and Hell Razers.

## Mission 3: Fight: Obtaining the Yellow Keycard
To get here, go out of the Field Drone area, and go straight veering around the Blue Keycard Area.  Before you enter, you may see some Plasma Ammo.

4 Imps, a Shielded Soldier and two Possessed Soldiers in back are ready to fight you.  The Shielded guy is the biggest problem, and the chainsaw may be the most effective way to deal with him.

Taking the Keycard creates a Checkpoint.

## Mission 3: Fight: Getting Away with the Yellow Keycard

Exiting the area triggers the creation of 2 Imps, a Hell Knight, and (down the hall) 2 Shielded Soldiers.  I usually run to the Field Drone location, lobbing a grenade behind me.

## Mission 3: Using the Yellow Keycard
As you approach the yellow keycard door, a Hell Knight will surprise you.
Entering the door creates a Checkpoint, so it is advisable to stock up on ammo, armor and health before entering.

## Mission 3: Fight: Hall after Yellow Keycard, before Gore Nest 3
After picking up whatever supplies from the anteroom,
enter a hall where some repair robots appear to be working on a crate.

Initially there are just two Possessed Soldiers (on the left-hand side)  If you stay near the entrance wall, nobody else will spawn, and it is suggested to kill these guys before charging in.

Then, a Hell Knight, a (few?) Imps, an a few Hell Razers will spawn.  Lobbing a grenade at the barrel can help, but the Hell Knight has to be dealt with.

One Secret (a doll) can be found in a crate being worked on (climb on top of it).

Another Secret (an Elite Guard) can be found by climbing crates at the back of the room.

## Mission 3:  Fight: Gore Nest 3

## Mission 3:  Finding the Blue Keycard

## Mission 3:  Fight: Gore Nest 4

## Mission 3:  Once all four Gore Nests are destroyed
The Turbine Room door, which the game will guide you to, is now unlocked.
/PONR/:  Once you enter this area, you can't return to get anything.  Also, you will get a Checkpoint before a big fight, so it is advisable to stock up on supplies before entering.

## Mission 3:  Fight:  Turbine Room
This fight as two waves, both consisting of Imps and Hell Razers (XXX: are there PS?).  At the end of the first wave is 1 Hell Knight; the second wave ends with 2 Hell Knights.

After completing the fight, exit at the top of the room, on the opposite side as the entrance.

## Mission 3:  End of Mission

# Mission 4:  Argent Facility

# Mission 5:  Argent Energy Tower

## Mission 5: Fight: Intro to Level, and Revenants

You start on a useless platform, and have to jump left to get to the Maintenance Hangar that VEGA alludes to.
Upon entering the building, look right, and you can see a Revenant eating a corpse.
It soon comes down to attack you.
There are a gaggle of demons on the floor below you, and more will spawn.
In total, there's about 3 Possessed Soldiers, 3 Hell Razers, 3 Possessed Engineers.
(No Imps, unfortunately, as it would help with the Chiropracter challenge.)

## Mission 5: Maintenance Hanger miscellany

Enter the locker room and retrieve the Jump Boots (as well as a Codex Entry and Shotgun Ammo).

Exiting the locker room, go right and double-jump up onto a platform;
U-turn and look left for another platform to up-jump.
Then down-jump into an enclosed area with a Rune Challenge,
suit of armor, and gas can.  To exit this area, jump down.

Jump up the same platforms used to access the Rune Challenge, but look across the area for a floor you can jump to, under a low-beam; some armor is at the end of the jump.
To the right is a crate and some rockets, but ignore them for now, and go left.
There is a platform to jump up on, and if you look around, you'll see another green-lit platform above to jump on.
Looking around from the top platform, you should see a short alcove that you can jump into:  there's an Argent Cell here.

## Mission 5: Crossing the Bridge, and Secret Guardhouse
...

## Mission 5: The Far Side of the Bridge
Elite Guard below.

Note:  You can get back, but it's not necessary and more difficult than jumping forward.

Cut scene.

## Mission 5: Lower Railway (Description and Secret)
As you can probably see by the Map (in the Dossier),
you are at the outside of the tall circular Argent Energy Tower.
Unmanned trains run around it's exterior, and you'll encounter them a few times.

You should see such an unmanned train going right every 5 seconds or so.  Follow it, and drop into an unused track.  Keep going, and you should see an entrance to a human-sized passageway on your left.

Upon entering the passageway, look back to find an Elite Guard.
Continue to find a Health Station and Codex Page "???".

At some point, the passage becomes narrower and darker, and we can make a detour to get the Collectible doll.

To get Secret #???: "??? Model / ???", re-enter the unused Train corridor at this point (by veering right).  Continuing down the corridor, you'll arrive at an unused, stationary train car.  Get onto it, by double-jumping onto the ledge to your right, then double-jumping onto the train car (don't worry: the upper-train won't hit you).
You should be able to see another dimly-lit ledge near where the upper train cars keep entering.
I found this jump to be quite tricky... but the trick is that you must be facing at the ledge (ie facing perpendicular to it / straight at it), which mean you must jump almost sideways, which in turn makes dodging the train above more difficult.
Once you are on this ledge, turn left and go up (parallel to train), then turn around and jump into the hole that the train is entering.
You must keep moving, but when you run out of floor, drop to the left, and you'll find the Model.
Drop down the train area to get back to the Elite Guard, and continue back to where the passage narrows and becomes darker.

OK, continue down this short dingy corridor, and you'll find a Hatch, at left, along with some ammo/weapon (XXX).

/PONR/: Dropping down this hatch is irreversible, and a Checkpoint is created immediately on hitting the ground.

## Mission 5: Fight: Base of Tower

## Mission 5: Activating the Drones

## Mission 5: Secret Original Doom Level Sidetrip

## Mission 5: Ascending on the Drone

## Mission 5: Fight: Upper Tower Fight

## Mission 5: Ascending upper Control Office

## Mission 5: Fight: Upper Control Office?? and stairs out

## Mission 5: Ascending to ???

## Mission 5: Pseudo-Fight: Before the Countdown Ends
You could conceivably use this to do some Weapon Upgrade Challenges or
Rune Challenges, but I usually focus on trying to conserve my 200/200 which means perservering for a long time, then taking the Invulnerability Powerup at some point.

TODO: Timings

# Mission 6:  Kadingir Sanctum

## Mission 6: Fight: To get the Yellow Skull
Because there are no Checkpoints, this sequence of fights is gathered together.

First, drop down to a plateau with a toxic pond and 3 The Possesseds - target-practice.  There's some armor.  Jumping across to Plasma Ammo, maybe a Gauss Cannon.

Climb up the stairs and kill 3 The Possesseds.

Venturing out will begin the pre-fight; the main fight won't begin until you get near the left edge.

Look down to the next lower platform and you'll see an Imp spawn: you can kill it immediately with a grenade.  Then a Revenant spawns: I usually use the rocket launcher, but whatever works.

Stand on ledge that has a suit of armor on it.  Look down below into the Main Pit Area, and soon you'll see 2 Mancubi lumbering around that you can carefully attack with the Rocket Launcher (preferably with Lock-On modification).

Quickly jump down the Pit area, to trigger two waves: 
* a bunch of Imps (and HR?) ending with a Hell Knight
* a bunch of Imps and a few Hell Razers, ending with 2 Hell Knights

## Mission 6:  Accessing and Using the Yellow Skull
The game's waypoint will lead you to a switch (only accessible once all the above demons are killed).  After actuating the switch, walk across the pit to a newly opened area with armor and the Yellow Skull.

Now, find the Yellow Skull Door, by walking up the path from where the last fight started.  Open the Door to walk in and find Slayer Testament ???, and an Elite Guard.

Proceed onward to the next fight.

## Mission 6: Fight: 2 Summomer Fight
This fight starts on a plateau overlooking another pit area with T-shaped bridges running atop it.

If you enter but don't move, there are 3 The Possessed you can kill.
Once you walk out toward the middle of the level, 3 Imps spawn.

Once you get to the edge of the plateau is when the bulk of the demons spawn.
On the center of the bridge, a Summoner will spawn.  Lock-On Rocket Launcher is a good way to get her (as suggested by the Weapon Upgrade challenge).
Another Summoner spawns on the left side of the lower area.

2 Hell Knights soon spawn, along with a mess of Hell Razers (etc???).

## Mission 6: Getting the Blue Skull
Follow the game's marker to a Chainsaw and Shotgun Ammo.
Continue down a passage to watch a series of islands appear, in the large cavern where the first fight began.

You can jump directly to the nearest island, or jump down and make slightly easier jumps up the islands.  In either event, a Skull-Switch is at the top; pressing it, you'll see a gate lift on the lower level.  Jump down there, killing The Possesseds flailing around.

The green mist will teleport you to the next area;
before doing that, head right to pick up supplies and Revenant Model (Astroguy) (a Secret).

Head through the teleporter.

You'll find a Blue Skull.  Upon taking it, a gate will open leading you back to the overlook of the Main Pit Area.

## Mission 6: Fight: Main Pit Area, part 2
Before you can do anything, 4 Imps will spawn up here.

Imps should start spawning below: carefully take them out with grenades or whatever.

A few Cacodaemons will spawn.  Two blasts with the Lock-On Rocket Launcher will kill them, or you can target their eye with the Assault Rifle, or Gauss Cannon works.  You'll also need to keep lobbing grenades to kill the Imps that like to hang out in the area to the right of the base of the long stairs.

At some point, to trigger more demons, you'll have to descend to the floor.  Take the Quad Powerup as needed (if you have 2 Power Upgrades, you'll refresh your health at this point, so it can be best to wait until you are damaged.
There is a wave of Revenants and a Hell Knight, another Cacodaemon, more Revenants, a Mancubus, and a number of Imps.

## Mission 6: Rune Challenge and Using the Blue Skull
/PONR/ WARNING:  This Rune Challenge is only accessible for a short while.  The protective gates around it are closed until you get the Blue Skull, and after ...  (XXX: is the Rune accessible during the above Fight??)

Accessing the Rune Challenge requires jumping onto the central Rock that held the Quad Powerup.  Jump onto the smaller upper island (there are two: jump toward the one closer to the Blue Door?).  Then you should see a man-made (or demon-made) ledge to your right, with a few small Healths.
Jump, and turn around and look up to see a higher island.  Jump to it - then continue the same direction to an upper ledge.  Climb a short ledge to a tunnel leading left to the Savagery Rune Challenge.

After finishing it, go back to the main rock (where the Quad Powerup was), and jump to the "balcony" with the Blue Skull Door.  Interact, and you'll be in a pale green stone hallway: immediately on your right is an alcove containing Gas and an Argent Cell.  Further down, is rockets.

## Mission 6: Fight: Misc Small Fights in the Cliff Area
First up, is 4 Unwilling (good Weapon Upgrade fodder for Super Shotgun or Heat Blast) with a Mancubus, and a second Mancubus that jumps up with the first dies.

Now is not a bad time to use the Invulnerability which is on a lower level near where you exit the tunnel.

Walking along the ledge, some Imps, 2 Lost Souls, a Revenant spawn.

Island-Jump across to be surprised by 2 Lost Souls, and a Hell Razer.  The HR can be used to work on the Combat Challenge.

Walk through the tunnel behind the Hell Razer, and you'll be on a new cliff, with a fire and a Elite Guard.  Look left and down and you'll see the first Cacodaemon.  There is second one, probably behind that rocky pinnacle.  Lock-On Rocket Launcher is a fool-proof way to deal with these guys.

Visit the Elite Guard.

Detour for Secret:  Jump to the Island with the Armor and jump across to a lower ledge.  Turn right, and a Hell Knight will spawn.  Behind him (to the left) is a small cave with the Chaingun (as a Secret).  Retrace your steps to the Elite Guard across the cavern.

Island-Hop using the upper chain of islands.  At the end of this sequence of 5? Islands is a Skull Switch:  you will see the Iron Gate to the next part of the level raise when you actuate it.

You won't get a Checkpoint until everything is cleared (except the Hell Knight)- usually that occurs after the pair of Cacodaemons.

## Mission 6: Fight: Second Pit

Enter to find yourself in yet another large arena centered around a "pit" with bloody floors.  To your left is a balcony from which you can deal with a few demons, most notably 2 Lost Souls.  There's a lot of Hell Razers, Imps, and Revenants, as well as 2 Hell Knights and a Mancubus at the end of the fight (the Mancubus only spawns as you approach the waypoint).

In the pit, there's a tunnel with many small armor and a Haste Powerup.

## Mission 6:  Rune Challenge: "Seek and Destroy"
After the fight a tunnel opens to the second Rune Challenge.

## Mission 6:  Extracurricular Activities around the second pit
You can continue up the stairs for the main campaign path, or you can return to the levels entrance and look for two small adjacent caves that opened up.

The right-hand cave has a suit of armor and an Automap.

The left-hand cave has a teleporter to a treasure room of sorts with a recording.
You could teleport back, but instead look for the exit corridor and find a Codex Entry and an Elite Guard.

Finish the detour by following the corridor and using the yellow lift to cross the chasm.  If you go straight, then left, you should see the stairs leading down to the Rune Challenge (and likely a suit of armor on them).

Descend the stairs about halfway (above the decorative gate) and look for a ledge to the left you can jump onto to find a secret:  the Mancubus Model Redguy.

Back at the top of the stairs, find a Field Drone (nows time to get the Gauss Cannon's Siege Mode) and a Codex Entry "Artifacts / Doom Marine".

A few stray small armor mark the top of a steep staircase.  Descend it to see a holographic replay of Dr Hayden and some guards.

/PONR/: Once you go through the gate ahead, you will no longer to able to get back to the earlier parts of the level.

Pass through the gate (it'll open for you), into a fight scene.

## Mission 6:  Fight: Hell Barons in Arena with two Subarenas

The fight is already underway between the first Hell Baron and a bunch of the Possessed and 6? Imps.  By far, the Gauss Cannon in Siege Mode is the easiest way to deal with the Hell Baron, then deal with the stragglers however you want.

At some point, a Summoner appears.  I usually use the Rocket Launcher, but Gauss Cannon or even Chainsaw works.

Another Hell Baron and some Imps arrive.

After that's all gone 6? Lost Souls spawn.  It is good to take shelter in the more protected subarena and pick them off with the Assault Rifle or Shotgun or whatever.

Finally, 2 Hell Barons spawn.  I use the Quad Powerup and the Super Shotgun.  If you already used the Quad Powerup, just keep moving and dodging their shots (they move fast, though) and use either the Gauss Cannon (you need to move fast, so no Siege Mode) or Super Shotgun.

## Mission 6:  Onward, after a short Secret Detour

OK, go back to the large main arena from the last fight.  There is a big cave.
Inside the cave (which can be a bit dark) is a lever: an Original Doom Level trigger.  The location of the level itself is on the lower floor closer to where you entered the arena, or simple walk off the ledge between the two subarenas, and drop down.

Or use the map: it looks quite distinct with a visible arrow drawn into the map in the Dossier.  Once there, the arrow marks the correct switch to press (ie the Left switch).  It accesses a Mega Health Bonus (although crudely rendered, it is just as effective as a modern-looking one).

Go back to the subarena that once held the Quad Powerup, and now should be decorated with a glowing green circular symbol.  When you approach the door, it will open.

## Mission 6: Fight: some small easy fights
First, there's about 6 Unwilling in this corridor... they are useful for Weapon Upgrade Challenges (eg Tactical Scope, Heat Blast, Super Shotgun, Pistol).
And 2 Lost Souls to watch out for.

Instead of charging out island-hopping, turn right, and go up some stairs to overlook a Mancubus and 2 Revenants fighting.  Help them kill each other with a suitable weapon (ie Rocket Launch or Gauss Cannon).

Go ahead and island-hop over to the largest platform which should have some shotgun ammo.  Turning left, 2 Cacodaemons will appear: kill them (using e.g. the rocket launcher).  Go to the edge where the Cacodaemons appeared, and look across the chasm to see that a few islands connect you to another dilapidated staircase across the way.  Make your way over.  The landing hand a few small health, a Codex Entry "Monsters / Mancubus" and Gas.

3 Unwilling and a Mancubus guard another tunnel: you should get a Checkpoint here.

Continue up some stairs, to find 4 more Unwilling wandering around some armor:
good target fodder.

A Codex Entry "Artifacts: Slayers Testament 3" is found.

The last easy fight is about 5 Imps fighting 10 Unwilling.  (I like to work on the Savagery Rune and the Seek and Destroy Rune for this easy fight).

Don't miss the Elite Guard here!

Enter a well-stocked tunnel ending with a Codex Entry "UAC Personnel / Olivia Pierce" for a Checkpoint preceding the final fight of the mission.

## Mission 6:  Fight: Finale

It comes in unseparated waves:
* 4? Imps and 3? Hell Razers
* 2 Hell Knights
* 4 Revenants
* 3 Mancubi
* 2 Hell Barons and 1 Mancubus

I tend to save the Quad Powerup and for the end; get the Armor on the toplevel (a sometimes overlooked location) early on to make it easier.  Keep on the move and kill quickly.

Walk up the hill to a holographic replay of some sort of ritual with a casket???

Interact with the screen ??? to exit the level.

# Mission 7:  Argent Facility (Destroyed)

## Mission 7: Introduction

Pick up a Codex Entry "Monsters / Barons of Hell"

Go ahead and exit to the outdoor walkway, turning right (since left is blocked by fire).

## Mission 7: Fight: One Cacodaemon on Walkway
Be surprised by a Cacodaemon; it's a bit annoying on this narrow walkway- with timing you can get it in one Gauss Siege Cannon, but one have space to dodge it as well.

## Mission 7: Getting back into Argent Facility 
At the end of the walkway, turn around and look for a walkway to jump up to.  Next, jump across to a train and follow it to a small landing with two tarp-covered crates.  Behind these crates is a lever for the Original Doom Level.
After actuating the lever, drop down to another walkway/landing with a grated floor, and turn around to see a large octagonal pillar with a large "1" on it.  Behind this pillar is Secret #6, "Classic Level / Doom 2: Underhalls".

Immediately upon exiting this area, turn right, to see a right-dirt floored alcove with some crates.  There is Secret #4, "Cacodaemon Model / Rageguy".  There's also some armor and Gas.

Now, jump your way up to the highest accessible walkway.

You'll get a checkpoint shortly before a long double-jump.  It's not really difficult though.  Continue until you are looking into a damaged corridor which crosses the chasm.

Drop into the hallway through the gaping hole in its roof.  Turn around to find an Elite Guard (along with some armor and shotgun ammo).

Go forward to the computer area.  Find a Codex Entry "Environments / Argent Facility".

Interact with the computer for a 48 second cut scene, whose immediate consequence is that you need a yellow keycard.  A marker will take you to the airlock, which has a screen you can interact with.

## Mission 7: Fight: Side Cargo Bay Exterior
While you may not see monsters immediately, they are just to the right:  a Hell Razer, a Possessed Engineer, and 6? The Possessed.  You can take care of many by shooting the barrel.  Expect 2 more Revenants, Imps, Possessed Soldiers, 2 Cacodaemons, and a Hell Knight.

## Mission 7: Fight: Maintenance Exterior
Drop down to another former gore nest location, near the large Union Aerospace tank, on a ground area with lots of fire, to get another small fight with Imps, Hell Razers and a Hell Knight.

There is a Hologram device near some ammo.

Look down into the next area.  This is the area that used to have a blue Force Field, but now just has some fires.  You should see the pale-orange glow of a Beserk Powerup.  Drop down.

## Mission 7: Fight: Main Cargo Bay
First to appear will be 2 Cacodaemons and 1 Imp.  One Cacodaemon often starts very low and can be chainsawed to solve several problems at once.

After that, Imps, 3? Revenants, and a Summoner appear.

In fact, the Beserk may outlast the fight: you can perhaps even you it to kill some stuff in an adjacent area.

## Mission 7: Fight: Main Cargo Bay Adjacent: old platform area
This area is easily skipped.

There's a Hell Knight and a few Imps.

## Mission 7: Fight: Main Cargo Bay Adjacent: through tunnel
This area is easily skipped.

A Hell Knight, a Hell Razer and at least 1 Imp.

This is the area that had the Lever for the classic doom secret in Mission 4.


## Mission 7: Accessing Rune Challenge "In-Flight Mobility"
From the Old Platform Area, there's a blue lift that'll drop you on the rock for this Rune.

Or, you can jump across from the cargo crates in front of the Security Station Doors.

NOTE: This challenge is frustrating for many people, since it has little margin for error.  However, it is worth the practice, because the Rune is critical for some of the bosses.  See Rune Challenges Section for specific advice.

## Mission 7: Fight: Security Station
To get here, from the Main Cargo Bay, look for a pile of 3 crates to climb on.  The door should have a marker on it (an in-game destination) and there should be Gas here.

Entering, there's even more supplies littered throughout a gory hallway.

Interact with the door to get a short cut-scene introducing us to the Pinky.

The fight begins with 2 Pinkies and at least 1 Possessed Soldier (and a hard-to-count number of The Possessed in the peripheries- most of these get killed by other demons!).

After killing those Pinkies, another way of 4? Pinkies (etc???) is triggered.

After the fight, visit the Auto-Map, and get the Codex Entry "UAC Personnel / Dr Samuel Hayden 2".

There's also a Health Station here.

After triggering and watching a holographic replay, you'll be allowed out the Security Station's second door.

## Mission 7: Fight: Exiting Security Station
Opening the door, you'll see a Pinky:  but there's actually 2 Pinkies.  As well as 2 Revenants, 2 Imps.   You can use the Quad Power-Up but I usually save it for the more tough fight coming up.  Once you kill all these guys you'll get a Checkpoint.

There's an Elite Guard on the top level.

Interact with the Munitions Crate in the far corner of the lower-level.
Unfortunately you'll need to re-do this each time you die:  on the positive side, this Munitions Crate refills between most battles.

## Mission 7: Fight: Exiting Security Station and Entering ???
This fight is triggered when you take the stairs across the chasm after killing everyone.

Initially there just a lot of The Possesseds staggering around, but a Revenant, an Imp, and a Cacodaemon are the first wave of guests to this party.

A second wave (somewhat indistinct), is another Revenant, Cacodaemon and a few Imps.

The third wave is different: two Pinkies and a Mancubus.   These guys come out of the hangar ahead of you, and if you time it right, you can take them out with a single satisfying Quad-Damage Siege Cannon on the bridge.

## Mission 7: Fight: Indoor Gore Nest
Enter the building picking up health, Gas, Plasma, and Codex Entry "Monsters / Mancubus 3".

Almost the entire pre-fight can be handled with a single Gauss Cannon Siege Mode shot.
Except you may have to deal with a pernicious Hell Razer, plus a lurking Shielded Guard (use the Gauss Cannon on this fool, who hides on the left as you approach the Nest).

Before destroying the Gore Nest:
* Consider taking the Megahealth Powerup on the crate above.
* You'll probably want to use your chainsaw, so find Gas where the Shielded Soldier hides (to the left as you initially walk toward the Gore Nest).
* The two Pinkies spawn in reliable locations, one near the entrance
* I usually retreat toward the entrance to minimize complications and environmental risks: your mileage may vary.

In addition to 2 Pinkies, a Hell Knight and a few Hell Razers spawn.

The finale is a Hell Baron, who starts on the far side of the room (with the Health Station and chainsaw).  I like to use the chainsaw on it, but the Gauss Cannon/Siege Mode is also quite effective.

## Mission 7: Post-Fight ??? Cleanup

Pickup all you can.  There should be a screen prompting "Reset Crane to Base?" to access near the bridge over the electrically charged floor.  Actuating the Crane will cause a large suspended block to move within jumping range.  Jump onto it, then jump right onto a catwalk.  The game should let you know you found a secret: this is Secret #5.

Access the Field Drone: I tend to choose Chain Gun / Mobile Turret here.

Exit through the door near the Health Station.

...

## Mission 7: Accessing Rune Challenge: Armored Offensive
Exit the building and turn left, killing an Imp and Revenant.

Jump across to the right and follow the walkway to the end to find the Rune Challenge "Armored Offensive".

This is a useful Rune for hard fights, since getting more armor is the same as more health, for the most part.

Now, turn around, and run back toward the waypoint.
To the left you'll find a Munitions Crate on a plateau.
Often there are The Possesseds stumbling around and even a Cacodaemon at times.
After killing all that, you should find a Checkpoint.

## Mission 7: Fight: Upper Gore Nest

Continue along the ledge, jumping around to the green-lit ledges.
At the top, you'll find an airship with some loot - including a Codex Entry "Monsters / Cacodaemon", a Hell Knight, a few Imps, and a bunch of Possessed worshipping the Nest.

Kill the Hell Knight and the Imps, and use the Possesseds for target practice.

When ready, destroy the Gore Nest.

Immediately a Hell Knight will spawn behind you, and some Imps and Hell Razers.

There will be 3 Cacodaemons and 3 Revenants over the course of the battle as well.

Toward the end of the battle, a Mancubus will emerge.

Use the Haste Powerup in the corner whenever you need a boost: this fight isn't too tough.

## Mission 7: Post Upper Gore Nest

Argent Cell:  Looking back the way you came, you should see a plateau at your elevation: it is easy to get to.  Once there, look down at see the Argent Cell: drop down to it and choose your powerup.

Go back to the site of the Gore Nest, and enter the door.

There is a Pinkie Corpse holding the Yellow Guard Corpse.  You can interact with it to get the Keycard.

There's also a secret here.  Look up for a bloody ledge in the ceiling at the left of the room on entry.  Find Secret #???, "Baron of Hell Model, Patriotguy".

Return to get the Yellow Keycard, watch the holographic replay, and use the Yellow Door.

Drop down the elevator shaft.  Before exiting the obvious way, turn around and look up to find a square duct: jump into it and find Elite Guard #4.

Exit the elevator shaft: you should recognize this as the site of an earlier Gore Nest battle.  Make a hairpin turn to the right and go in the Yellow Keycard Door.

## Mission 7: Fight: Tram Access
A few Possessed Soldiers and a number of The Possessed lurk here, useful for some Weapon Upgrade tasks.  When ready, interact with the Tram console to finish the level.
