# Acknowledgements and Caveats
Thanks, id Software for making such a great game!

Also, watching zomeister's Pistol-Only walkthrough helped me with several strategy points. So props to that individual: please watch the madness if you want to be inspired:

Caveats: I have not read the "Official" Guide by Prima Guides at this point.
I may do so soon and amend this guide, as time permits.

# Introduction and Game Mechanics

## Overview
Welcome to Doom 4, an intense and sensory First Person Shooter!

The game is set mostly in a large energy facility on Mars, with occasional forays into Hell!

The game is heavy on action and fighting, and it keeps its cut-scenes short and punchy.

The visuals are impressive, contrasting space-tech with organic demons.
They are also pretty gory: potential nightmare fodder for kids.
Even though you will plow your way through hundreds of monsters in these missions, at least none were human at the time of death.

## Basic Plot Summary
You awaken to being chained to a bed,
and quickly assume the hero's role: combatting an experiment with Hell gone awry.
Over the missions, you'll see that cutting-edge research into new energy sources degenerated into cultish madness, including ritualistic sacrifices.
It's up to you to stop the unleashed demons.

## Weapons

### Pistol
What the Pistol lacks in power it makes up for by having unlimited ammo.

The lack of power can be an advantage if you are trying to stun a demon in order to Glory Kill it, if you are trying to extract more stuff from the kill.

My upgrade strategy: save the upgrades for the end, or maybe induldge in the first 1 point upgrade.
There are more important ways to spend one's upgrade points.

### Shotgun (available Mission 0)
Although the shotgun is eclipsed by the Super Shotgun (which is much better, once upgraded), you'll have no real choice for the first few missions.
Because of this, it isn't really worth putting Weapon Upgrade points into the shotgun, at least not until later in the game if you are trying to get 100%.

When you get to the first Field Drone, the Shotgun is the only weapon you have to modify, so you have to get a mod at this early point:  go for Explosive Shot, which is easier to use to get the "Twofer" Challenge (for Mission 2).

Cyber-Mancubi count as Mancubi for the Changed Shot Upgrade Challenge.

(Technically, the game refers to this weapon as the "Combat Shotgun", but nobody calls it that.)

### Plasma Gun (available Mission 2)
Although it's individual shots are rather weak, it fires quite rapidly.

More importantly, Heat Blast is a really powerful Weapon Modification.
Basically, it allows you to kill everything near you at the same time without using ammo, BUT it requires you to shoot the gun to charge up the blast.
There are 2-4 places you can use the Heat Blast and Quad Damage Powerup to really plow through large numbers of demons.

I haven't found the Stun modification to be very useful: it wastes ammo, it's hard to stun more than 2 demons, they don't stay stunned long, and you still have to kill them (taking both time and ammo usually).

### Assault Rifle (available Mission 2)

Each individual shot from the Assault Rifle is rather weak and becomes weaker and harder to hit from a difference.  Few demons can be killed with a single shot;
expect a cacodaemoon (etc) to take 30+ shots even up close.

ihe Tactical Scope changes things a bit: it makes the thing pretty effective for sniping, and the upgrades make it pretty damaging.
Even so, it's a bit tedious killing things with this weapon.  
However, it makes for a nice change, since the opportunities for sniping are few in this game.
You can usually get the challenge upgrade naturally over the course of the game, but you can also replay an earlier mission to get it pretty easily.

The Mini-Missiles seems like a cool upgrade but they aren't that powerful or predictable.  One nice use is for dealing with multiple Lost Souls.  Most other monsters are too strong for this to be an elegant attack.

### Super Shotgun (available Mission 4)

A weapon big enough that it'll at least distract anything.  Fully upgraded, it's my weapon of choice for Hell Knights, or combats with a long chain of individual demos.

The challenge upgrade can be a bit difficult:  I usually get very close to one demon and shoot through it to get to another one close behind; this seems easier than lining them up side-to-side.

### Chain Gun (available Mission 6)

A powerful weapon that is a bit annoying to use because it takes a
a few seconds to start up.

The Gattling Rotator works, but you have to hold down the modifications button
the entire time: I don't really like that.

The Mobile Turret mod is a great way to deliver a lot of damage.
I usually try to fully upgrade this modification since it's useful against bosses.

### Gauss Cannon (available Mission 5)
The most powerful standard weapon, even without mods.  Siege Mode is the most powerful mod (by far), and it is strongly recommended.  Its challenge upgrade is easy too.

The Precision Bolt mod is also pretty good but it's a lot harder to fully upgrade and only kills once thing at a time, so I seldom use it.

### BFG (available Mission 8)
The Big F-ing Gun.  This will clear out a whole room of demons, but it can be a little unpredictable in how it works.

Ammo is found individually, and you always have a limit of 3.  However, the Ammo Boost II rune WILL cause enemies to randomly drop BFG ammo when they die so there isn't too much of a shortage.

### Chainsaw (available Mission 2)
This crazy melee weapon will definitely kill any monster (except Bosses) in range that
you have enough fuel to kill.  The initial capacity is 3 Fuel Units, which is the amount in every gas can.  Each Argent Cell upgrade to the Ammo Capacity increases your capacity by 1 Fuel.
So fully upgraded, you have a capacity of 7 Fuel Units.

Killing with a chainsaw is considered a Glory Kill that'll dump a huge pile of ammo.

Fuel to kill various demons:
* Imp: 1
* The Possessed: 1
* Unwilling: 1
* Possessed Guard: 1
* Possessed Securities: 1
* Hell Razer: 1
* Hell Knight: 3
* Summoner: 3
* Cacodaemon: 3
* Pinkie: 3
* Spectre: 3
* Revenant: 3
* Mancubus: 5
* Cyber-Mancubus: 5
* Hell Baron: 5

### Weapon Upgrade Path: In My Humble Opinion
Here's how I upgrade my weapons.  I usually upgrade one-at-a-time, simply because that spaces the Upgrade Challenges out more.

* Plasma Rifle / Heat Blast
* Rocket Launcher / Lock-On
* Super Shotgun
* Gauss Cannon / Siege Mode
* Assault Rifle / Tactical Scope  (Often I get the first two upgrades before Siege Mode is available)
* Pistol
* Rocket Launcher / Remote-Detonation


## Monsters

### The Possessed, Unwilling

These idiots simply stagger around, vaguely coming toward you.

In Nightmare mode, they do quite a bit of damage; in easier modes they are merely pesky.

### Imps

Monkeys with fireballs with great aim.
You have to move constantly and keep a lookout to avoid getting hit.

They can take a fairly large amount of damage when they are climbing around on vertical surfaces.

For players in Nightmare mode, Imps will probably cause more deaths than any other demon.

## Possessed Engineers

Somewhat like the Possessed, except they explode when they die, and they charge at you to cause trouble.

These guys are walking bombs - typically when they die they'll fly away from you which mitigates the problems.  But some weapons might cause them to fly at you, and they'll do moderate damage.

Even if you jump from above them and Glory Kill them, it does not count as a Death From Above Glory Kill (at least for the purposes of Rune or Combat Challenges).  I'm assuming they their firey plume keeps them safe ?  TODO: read the damn codex on this


### Possessed Soldiers and Possessed Securities

These two monsters differ in that the latter has shields.

They have 3 attacks:
* Plasma Volley: an attack of many straight-moving weak plasma baubles
* Plasma Grenade: a stronger attack, similar to the Rocket Launcher / Remote Detonation.  It expands before blowing up like a bomb.
* Melee Attack: these are fairly weak for Possessed Soldiers, but they are quite strong from the shielded soldiers

The shields are a big difficulty: the Gauss Cannon or Chainsaw are the surest ways to kill them - you'll run into them before you have the Gauss Cannon.
Otherwise, try running around them (around a structure) or jumping over them.
Also they have to put their shields down when the jump/drop.

### Hell Razers
These hellions attack with a laser in their arm, or a melee attack.

They have a lot of hit-points, but they aren't too hard to kill.

### Lost Souls
These little punks are very damaging.

It's best to snipe them from afar
(effective weapons:
Assault Rifle/Tacticle Scope,
Rocket Launcher/Lock-On,
BFG).
At the last moment when they are swooping in on you, the Shotgun or Super-Shotgun is probably the best, if you're quick.

They can make little turns, but you can sneak behind pillars or protected areas.

### Hell Knights
These are brutal melee attackers.

They will jump toward you very fast.

It is best to approach them right after an attack (Super Shotgun, Gauss Cannon) then back-off - a kind-of dance, or just use the Chainsaw which'll definitely kill them if you have fuel.

### Summoners
These red-dressed ladies fire intense energy beams along the floor.
Fortunately, the shot comes with a harmless pre-shot, so if you see a short red flame running along the ground, get away from it.

The Rocket Launcher / Lock-On's Multi-Target Upgrade requires 5 kills on Summoners, so if you want to get that upgrade, you'll want to kill every summoner with lock-on rockets.  That said, this upgrade isn't particularly useful.

### Cacodemons
Big floating eyeballs with gigantic purple missiles.

They do (as a hint notes) have a weak point near their eye opening,
and precision shots with the tactical shot of the assault rifle can kill it from afar pretty quickly.

### Revenants
These tough lanky flying demons wear a backpack to shoot you from above.
They can take a significant amount of damage.

The visible patch on the sternum (center of the chest) is a weak point.

### Pinkies and Spectres
These are big charging idiot monsters.  The Pinkies are substantially heartier.
They are literally pink.  The Spectres are essentially camoflaged Pinkies.  They blend into their surroundings.

I suggest using Super Shotgun, Chainsaw, Gauss Cannon on these guys.  But really, any weapon will work.

Their tail/backside is their weakness.  A single point-blank Super Shotgun blast to the base of the tail will usually kill it.  (Two such shots definitely will, but most of the time the Pinky will start moving before you can get a second shot)

### Mancubi and Cyber-Mancubi
These large (obese) demons shoot damaging fireballs.  The Cyber-Mancubi are somewhat more annoying because their shots leave a toxic (green) residue that you must avoid (it only lasts a few seconds).

The visible patch on the sternum (center of the chest) is a weak point.

### Hell Barons
These are like Hell Knights except that they can shoot missiles.  With horns.

They are really not that tough, because they can be taken down by 2 Gauss Cannon / Siege Mode shots.

## Equipment

Generally speaking, most players use mostly one type of Equipment: the Frag Grenade.
It is effective, you get it early on, and it is easy to understand.

The Siphon Grenade is substantially harder to aim, and less damaging, so it isn't used too much.

The Hologram (sometimes called the Decoy) seems like a good idea, but I really haven't found places I personally like to use it.

Contact me if you have suggestions for Siphon Grenades or Holograms!

### Frag Grenades
These have both good radius and damage and are recommended.  I know that as a beginner, I under-used them.  One problem is that they take a long time to regenerate until you get the first Praetor Suit Equipment Upgrade.

### Siphon Grenades
These pull energy from demons in their radius and give it to you.  But the amount transferred isn't that great, so it tends to be overlooked.

## Weapon Upgrade Tokens
You spend these to improve your weapons:

Weapon | Upgrades | Upgrade Points Required For All Mods
--- | --- | ---
Assault Right | Tactical Scope, Mini Missiles | 18
Combat Shotgun | Charged Shot, Explosive Shot | 18
Plasma Rifle | Heat Blast, Stun Gun | 18
Chain Gun | Gattling Revolver, Mobile Turret | 18
Gauss Cannon | Precision Bolt, Siege Mode | 18
Rocket Launcher | Lock-On, Remote Detonation | 18
Super Shotgun | - | 9
Pistol | - | 9
--- | --- | ---
Total | | 126

You earn Weapon Upgrade Tokens as follows:

Mission | Exploration | Challenges | Combat | Bonus | Bosses | Total | Cumulative
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1: The UAC | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2
2: Resource Operations | 2 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 7
3: Foundry | 2 | 3 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 10 | 17
4: Argent Facility | 2 | 3 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 10 | 27
5: Argent Energy Tower | 2 | 3 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 10 | 37
6: Kadingir Sanctum | 2 | 3 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 10 | 47
7: Argent Facility (Destroyed) | 2 | 3 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 10 | 57
8: Advanced Resource Complex | 2 | 3 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 10 | 67
9: Lazarus Labs | 2 | 3 | 5 | 2 | 6 | 18 | 85
10: Titan's Realm | 2 | 3 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 10 | 95
11: The Necropolis | 2 | 3 | 5 | 0 | 6 | 16 | 111
12: VEGA Central Processing | 2 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 0 | 15 | 126
13: Argent D'Nur | 2 | 3 | 5 | 0 | 6 | 16 | 142

So, if you 100% the game you should have 142 - 126 = 16 unusable Weapon Upgrade points at the end.  Another way to look at it:  there are 16 extra Weapon Upgrades Points.

That said, the extra combat upgrades have to be earned, so earning 100% on one playthough (ie without taking advantage of Mission Replay or dying), is logistically tricky, if not impossible.

## Checkpoints
Checkpoints save your ammo, health and armor levels, as well as the locations of pickups of the same nature.

On the other hand, Secrets, Argent Cells, and Elite Guards are all saved without making a checkpoint.

This system usually works quite well, but the Argent Cells have a side-effect of filling up whatever power you upgrade.  This isn't saved unless you find a checkpoint elsewhere.  This rarely comes up besides in Mission 7 where we provide some advice.

### Checkpoints, in Summary

Things that are captured immediately:
* Secrets, Argent Cell, Elite Guard usage

Things that are preserved by checkpoints:
* demon kills
* pickups (except those dropped by demons)
* Health, Armor and Ammo levels

Things that are lost by dying after a checkpoint:
* the fill-up delivered by Argent Cells
* partial (pending) powerups at the time of the checkpoint

## Your Dossier
These are accessed by the central button on PS4.

These pages are introduced pretty well described by in-game tutorials,
so I'm not going to repeat all that information.

* When you get an Auto-Map, the effect is to enhance the map in your Dossier.  Praetor Suit upgrades can improve the map in various ways
* Weapons and Praetor Suit Upgrades are explained over the first few Missions
* Tutorial Codex pages are automatically added to the Codex page.
* The Codex page will let you see if you have missed any Codex Entries

## Navigation
Your dossier has a 3-d map that is pretty nice,
but it doesn't give a coordinate system, nor labels for places,
nor even a reference direction, like North.
It does provide some icons that can be used as landmarks.

Fortunately, almost every location in this game looks somewhat different, so it's not so bad.  But pay attention to the names given to certain major rooms/locations, since usually if i give it a name, then you'll arrive there a few times.

## Difficulty Levels
Based on my own experience (and I could be wrong):
* difficulty levels affect:
  * damage done by demons
  * gains from ammo, armor, and healh pickups
  * runes: Rich Get Richer
* difficulty levels do not affect:
  * number or placement of demons
  * chainsaw
  * secrets (except the size of an Armor pickup)
  * runes: In-Flight Mobility
* i'm not sure if these are affected:
  * health of monsters
  * damage of user's weapons
  * environmental damage to the user
  * environmental damage to the demons

Difficulty level     | Max Imp Fireball Damage | Small Armor Pickup
---                  | ---                     | ---
Please Don't Hurt Me | ...                     | 5
Hurt Me Plenty       | ...                     | ...
Ultra-Violence       | ...                     | ...
Nightmare            | ...                     | 1

Ultra-Nightmare is the same as Nightmare for this information.


## Runes

I provide hints about how to complete the Runes Challenges where you come across them.  These are hints about when to use runes, and how to upgrade them (as easily as possible- both on a single playthrough as well as using Mission Replay).


### Vacuum

Easy to get and the most important rune.  Upgrading is easy as well - jump make sure to remember to equip it after you complete the challenge (it won't remind you in nightmare mode).

### Dazed and Confused

This rune comes in handy for the Bosses at the end of Mission 11, and for fulfulling the Combat Challenge "To Be Knighted" for Mission 4: without the Jump Boots, Death From Above Glory Kills on Hell Knights can require some setup.

### Ammo Boost

Very useful: I have this on much of the time.

### Equipment Power

This will make your grenades pretty powerful, and is basically trivial to upgrade (just throw 30 grenades with the rune enabled).  If you upgrade your Equipment Power using Praetor Tokens, it'll make grenade throwing faster, and hence make the upgrade easier to get and more powerful.

### Seek and Destroy
Useful for most berserk powerups - and those are great times for upgrades.

### Savagery
Useful for most berserk powerups.

### In-Flight Mobility
This rune is almost vital for the last boss fight - and the upgrade is pretty critical too.

It might make sense to work on this upgrade at the same time as the Dazed and Confused upgrade.

Challenge tips:  there is very little room for error.  You must single jump across the split every time - if you double-jump (which is tempting, because the separation is pretty wide for a single-jump), it'll waste valuable time.  The crux is probably hitting the annoying mid-air relic in the second half of this course, but note that you have two chances at it, since you have to jump left-to-right then right-to-left in that area.  Obviously most people aim to get it in the first jump, but it's good to keep cool if you miss it on the first jump since you have another chance.

Upgrade notes:  You need to get 25 Mid-Air kills.  Note that "Mid-Air" refers to you, not the demon.  As a result, glory-kills from above are probably the easiest way to get this, so it makes sense to try to combine this upgrade with the Dazed and Confused upgrade.

### Armored Offensive

Very useful, easy to upgrade, just keep it on a lot.
Also, the upgrade is measured it armor points you pick up.  In particular, picking up a Mega-Health will contribute 200 points for this upgrade.

### Blood-Fueled

Useful during Berserk Powerups - this is also a good time to get the upgrade.

### Intimacy is Best
There's only one place this upgrade is helpful (unless you count mission replay): the Atop the Mountain challenge in Mission 10.

Upgrade hint: although you might think this would be efficient to get in conjunction with
the various glory-kill upgrades, it's probably best to upgrade this by finding a group of The Possesseds and staggering them over and over again with the pistol.  It only takes about a minute or so.

### Rich Get Richer

This is quite useful in several Argent D'Nur fights.

To upgrade this, you need 12 Armor Fillups.  An Argent Cell counts, as do Mega-Healths.  But you'll struggle to get about 6 of those.  One options is to use Toxic-Sludge to do a single point of damage -- Unfortunately there's really only one fight [....] that has easy access.

Upgrade hint:  in Nightmare mode, getting up to full Armor is difficult, except when the Mega-Health powerup.  If you don't mind dying multiple times, there are a few Mega-Healths you can use to get the upgrade.
you can die and multiply get several Mega-Health, Toxic Sludge is a convenient way to drop just a single health at a time.  

### Saving Throw

A possibly useful safeguard in Ultra-Nightmare or Arcade Mode, but in casual play for campaign mode, not too useful.


# Mission-by-Mission Plot Summary (SPOILERS!)
For the most part, the plot in this game isn't very important.
But I wanted to summarize the whole plot briefly so casual players can refresh their memories.

Before any mission, you, Doomguy, are awoken from your slumber.
You learn in a cut-scene that a satellite must be realigned to learn the status of the complex: THE UAC (Mission 1) (abbrev for Union Aerospace Complex). 
First you must gain access to the .... 
From there, you are taken to RESOURCE OPERATIONS (Mission 2): first half of mission is to realign the satellite (merely requires getting to a particular terminal).
The second half of the mission is to get to a VEGA Terminal, where you learn the extent of the catastrophe.

The discussion is interrupted by news of an emergency in THE FOUNDRY (Mission 3).
At the end of Mission 3, you learn Olivia Pierce is the source of the disruption, and that she's headed for a hugely concentrated argent beam.
The first plan of attack is to disable the filters that feed argent energy to the tower in the ARGENT FACILITY (Mission 4).  But, of course, it turns out that the Tower is still dangerous, and you have to get up there to try to disable it.

Before climbing the ARGENT ENERGY TOWER (Mission 5), you have to get to it,
which involves of a lot of jumping around on catwalks (what I call "The Bridge").  Getting up is similar.
Ultimately, Olivia beats you to it, and the portal is opened.

After that, the missions have a general arc: trying to close a portal to hell.

The force of the portal opening transports you into hell.
This area of hell is known as KADINGAR SACTUM (Mission 6): where you were excavated from.
Somehow, they set up a portal at the end of the mission that returns you to the ARGENT FACILITY (DESTROYED) (Mission 7).

This time, you are here to catch a tram to the ADVANCED RESEARCH COMPLEX (Mission 8).
You'll finally meet Dr Samual Hayden.  Then you'll go to the weapons division, LAZARUS LABS (Mission 9).  This level concludes in a boss fight, in two parts.  Part 1: you fight the demon on Mars and rip out the argent accumulator, which sends you back to hell.  Part 2: in Hell, ... TODO

TITAN'S REALM (Mission 10).

NECROPOLIS (Mission 11).

VEGA CENTRAL PROCESSION (Mission 12).

ARGENT D'NUR (Mission 13).

# Using this Guide
Secrets, Field Drones, Argent Cells, Rune Challenges are all written in uppercase at their secret location, with dotted notation where the first number is the mission and the secret is the index of the location in the Dossier Overview/Map page.
For example, SECRET 14.3 would be the third secret in the dossier in mission 14 (but there's really only 13 missions).  This is intended to facilitate searching.

As a perhaps dubious consistency I will use all-caps the first time you meet a monster or can collect a weapon.  Subsequently, I will use title case.

(In the case of monsters, there are two grammatically annoying ones: The Possessed and Possessed Security.  I'm just going use them like they were real nouns, and i'll therefore pluralize them as The Possesseds and Possessed Securities.)

I will use title case (ie first letters capitalized) for various other collectibles: Suit of Armor, Small Armor, Health Station, Mega-Health, etc.

Similarly CHECKPOINT is always written uppercase to indicate that the game will give a checkpoint.
The significance of that is that it is nice to load up on supplies right before getting the checkpoint.
(So that if you die, you won't have to get the supplies again)

# About this Guide
This is the first Walkthrough that I (Dave Benson) have written.
I hope you find it useful.

I am no expert game player.
I just really like this game,
and decided to write a walkthrough since the one like I wanted didn't exist.

I found it to be an interesting challenge,
mostly due to the difficulty of describing locations.

I welcome contributions, compliments, suggestions, errata, strategies, complaints, and donations.  Contact me via github for details, or submit bug reports:

# Mission 0:  Pre-UAC

At the beginning of the game, you wake up chained to an operating table.
As you break out of your bonds, four demons surround you, your first encounter with THE POSSESSED.

Before you have control, you kill one by hand, and grab a pistol.

Shoot the remaining three.

Interact with the screen (to the right of the door) and
proceed into the central room with the Praetor Suit.  Interact with it, and
meet Dr Hayden.

Ultra-Nightmare skips the Mission 0 fights.

## Mission 0: Mini-Fight 0.1: Glory Kill Tutorial

You will come upon a staggered The Possessed.
After killing it, kill the remaining 4 weaklings.

## Mission 0: Mini-Fight 0.2: Meet the Imp

Interact with a corpse to get the SHOTGUN.

Enter the next room.

A quick cut-scene will play as the IMP scurries down from the rafters.
Kill it, obviously (using the Shotgun).

## Mission 0: Fight 0.3: Blue Elevator Chamber

You exit the anteroom to see 8? The Possessed worshipping an Orb.  You can Glory Kill them if you need health or kill them en masse by shooting the barrel.

After destroying the Orb, about 15? Imps will gradually materialize.
Keep moving!
There are two sheltered areas:  the entrance area,
and a control-room overlooking the main chamber.

Grab all stray stuff before entering the elevator.  CHECKPOINT.

# Mission 1:  The UAC "Rip and Tear"

## Mission 1: Intro
The mission starts with you exiting an elevator, and dropping onto a lower plane.  3 small armor pieces are there; proceed upward to find CODEX ENTRY "Environments / The UAC".

As you approach another tall cliff, you can see Imps running off into the horizon: these can be shot but it's not worth the effort.  You can also shoot The Possesseds below, but it's better to use them as walking health bonuses.

## Mission 1: Fight 1.1: Pre-Blue-Keycard

This is the first real fight of the game.  It occurs on a 2-level dual-figure-eight structure.

If you are quick and accurate, you can target some imps on the cliffs above, and you can shoot at The Possesseds below.  In my opinion, these aren't worth spending time on.

Like many fights throughout the game, you will learn your own opening gambit.
For me, I target the 2 POSSESSED SOLDIERS that appear right in front of you:  one in the center in front of a pinnacle, and one at right near a barrel that can be shot.
After that, just keep moving and shooting.

You'll be able to recharge over the next easy fight, so use up all the health and armor during the fight.

## Mission 1: Keycard and Secret

After the demonic threat is neutralized, a gate opens up, opposite the entrance location.
However, another gate immediately (requiring the Blue Keycard) blocks progress.  Turn right and walk down a tunnel.  Behind a large block is a corpse with a Blue Keycard.

After getting the keycard, stand on the block and look around for a tunnel above you.  You should jump to it, and pick up SECRET 1.1 and your first collectible, COLLECTIBLE 1.1 "Combat Shotgun Model, Blueguy".

Continuing through the tunnel, you'll get to the gate, which will open.

You'll get some ammo, but more importantly, the FRAG GRENADE, which is very useful, especially once your suit's equipment upgrades are done.

## Mission 1:  Mini-Fight 1.2: Stray Possessed and Imps

There's about 6 The Possesseds and 3 Imps.

After killing those guys, enter the cave to the right (at the top of the incline).  You will find some worshipping Possessed and an Auto-map.  Continue out the cave to find a Praetor Token (ELITE GUARD 1.1) on the right before jumping down.

## Mission 1:  Mini-Fight 1.3: Stray Imps

As you drop down the last level of this spit of land, 5 Imps will attack from various directions.

CHECKPOINT.

After that, look for the large tank with TRI 9-C printed on it, and enter its lower level.  There is a lever through that you should interact with then enter the Classic Doom Level.  Exit the structure and you should be able to see up the path to SECRET 1.2, CLASSIC MAP 1.1 "Doom II: Entryway".

## Mission 1: Classic Fight 1.4: Classic Doom Level

There are 4 Possessed Soldiers standing on pedestals in here.
I usually use a Frag Grenade to kill the left one, then snipe the right one from just under the pillar.  The remaining two can be taken out one-at-a-time.

If you actuate the switch nearer the entrance, you can get some minor booty.
Mostly, this fight isn't worth the effort.

After this, jump onto the crates at the end of the landing bay, and jump the chasm.

At the end of this area, you may catch a glance of the Field Drone flying away to the right.  But go left to an area with Health and Armor, and the second CODEX ENTRY "Environments / The UAC".

## Mission 1: Fight 1.5: Just Across the Chasm
Go back, and to the right where you saw the Field Drone; it's floating right ahead.  Interact with it:  I tend to get Charged Shot as it makes an upcoming challenge easier, but either (or none) can be used.

You will come across some The Possesseds worshipping a corpse.  There are 3 Possessed Soldiers around in the peripheries as well, and they will be join in the fun by some Imps that'll spawn, potentially close to you.

After killing them, CHECKPOINT.

## Mission 1: Fight 1.6: Pre Entranceway Area
This canyon can be approached in two ways:
* go directly up the canyon
* back up and ascend some cliffs to the left (there's a Medium Health visible), cross over the canyon on a land bridge, then turn left and climb up a yellow metal wall.

Either way, expect 5+ Imps (plus some The Possesseds).

CHECKPOINT.

You should see a suit of Armor on a small plateau.  Just before that, at the canyon's bottom, look around for a small backfacing greenlit "secret" tunnel.
It leads to a cliff with SECRET 1.3 to COLLECTIBLE 1.2 "Imp Model, Classicguy".

## Mission 1: Fight 1.7: Station Entrance
You can approach this fight up the main road (over the plateau with a suit of armor), or from the side using the plateau to the right.
Use grenades to knock these forces back, and retreat to snipe at the various demons.

It's about 6? Possessed Soldier, 6? Imps, and 12? The Possessed.

Search all over for ammo.

Now, go up to the top level.  You'll see a medium Health.  And at the end of both of the broken tracks there are carts containing Health and Ammo.

Enter into either of the twin doors, there's some armor - pick it up if needed, then proceed to the waypoint.

# Mission 2:  Resource Operations "Know Your Enemy"

## Mission 2: Notes on Combat Challenges
* Two-fer:  This is easy with the Explosive Shot: use the Weapons Mod key and shoot a Possessed that is in close range of another Possessed.  Or stagger one in order to line them up carefully.  It can be done without weapon mods by staggering two Possessed and getting really close to one and shooting through it to the other staggered being.
* Variety is the Spice of Death I: perform 5 different Glory Kills on the Possessed.  There's a lot of options; use the Pistol (instead of Shotgun) to more reliably stagger (as opposed to kill) them.
* Quite the Explorer: Find 3 Secrets.  This should be pretty easy, with this guide.

## Mission 2:  Mini Fight 2.1:  Before opening hatch
5 Possessed wait here, and 2 Imps spawn quickly.  Kill the Imps and use the Possesseds to work on either Challenge "Variety is the Spice of Death I" or "Twofer" (this is easiest using the Explosive Shot modification).

You can't open the hatch yet: "Low Power".  Instead, open a door to find a number of The Possessed, and keep going to an Imp at the top of the stairs.
"Reset Power" (by interacting with a screen), to watch a bit of a cut-scene featuring an Olivia Pierce recording.

Looking down at the stairs from the top, you should see a platform at your level with a blood smear on the back wall: a standard marker for a secret in this game.  Go there, and look for some ducts to climb through.  You'll get to SECRET 2.1 and a suit of armor.

Back at the bottom of those steps, find an Auto-Map:  use it.

Continue to the waypoint and an Open the Maintenance Bay Door.

## Mission 2:  Mini Fight 2.2:  Tiny fight in catwalk area with Original Doom Level
Some Possessed are followed by 3 Imps.  Go where they originated onto a crane-like catwalk.  Jump over its left railing, and look for a platform somewhat above you:  jump to it.  Look for the Lever and pull it.

Jump back down, keeping an eye out for some Imps that'll spawn right around you.  You should see the SECRET 2.8, CLASSIC MAP 2.1 "Doom - Hangar" up a small staircase with some Health and Shotgun ammo.

After that, open the door with the waypoint to meet the Possessed Engineer.  Shoot him and he'll fly back, killing the numerous Possesseds in the background.

A battle awaits after opening the next door.

## Mission 2:  Fight 2.3:  U-shaped catwalk area
This can be a difficult fight, but judicious use of Grenades, Barrels, and Possessed Engineers can make it fairly painless.

Post Fight:  There's CODEX ENTRY "Environments / Resource Operations" and a door.

You can enter the room through a path with more goodies by looking for a screen in the left of the control console that you can interact to "???".  This will stop the fast moving elevators at the central part of the U.  Climb up the elevators and enter through the second story for health, armor, and shotgun ammo.

No matter which way you go, you'll be in a locker room with some Shotgun Ammo, the Chainsaw, and a Health Station.

## Mission 2:  Fight 2.4:  Industrial Train Depot
A long hallway fight, with a bit of a side-corridor at the end.

You can fight it from the entrance gate, or you can charge in.
There's a few barrels that you can shoot to good effect; grenades are also helpful here, as can be the chainsaw.

??? CHECKPOINT.

## Mission 2:  Getting the yellow keycard
Cross the train-tracks on the far-side of the room from your entrance.  You will see a gas canister across the tracks.  Turn left and carefully go through the hatch which automatically opens and closes.  It is an elevator.  When the door opens on the upper level, there should be a large armor.  Take it and go forward.  There should be a train on the left leading back to the Industrial Train Depot, and on the right is a Security Station.

Drop drop and take out the few The Possesseds.

## Mission 2:  Mini Fight 2.5: In front of Security Station
4 The Possesseds.

Load up on health and armor before proceeding, since the next fight can be tough.

Since you don't have the Yellow Keycard yet, you will have to go down the hall
to a developed outdoor area.

CHECKPOINT.

## Mission 2:  Fight 2.6: Developed Outdoor Gore Nest
Before destroying the gore nest, take out the 6? The Possesseds possibly using Glory Kills to get more health.  I tend to use the pistol to save ammo.

After destroying the Gore Nest, a large number of Imps and Possessed Soldiers appear, keep moving and shoot the barrels to kill some of them while saving ammo.  Make note of the two supply caches containing ammo+health before starting.

Hint: The chainsaw is useful here to kill 3 demons and get lots of ammo.

## Mission 2:  Getting the yellow keycard (continued)

On the lower level, Call the Elevator and see a replayed cut-scene of the demon carrying the Yellow Keycard guard.  Enter the elevator and press the button.

On a catwalk area you'll find some health, FIELD DRONE 2.1, shotgun ammo and the corpse of the Yellow Keycard guard.  I recommend waiting to use the field drone until you have the Plasma Rifle.  Take the Yellow Keycard and watch out!

Go through the hatch then drop down into the Industrial Train Depot, right in front of a Yellow Keycard Door.

Optionally, you can go through the yellow door and then into a control-room area which has the ASSAULT RIFLE.  But go back to the industrial train depot to obtain a bunch of secret stuff.

So, retrace your earlier steps to the Security Station which you can now access!  Take the supplies and interact with a terminal to unlock the doors

Continue re-tracing your steps.  In the hallway, on the floor to the right, is a Hatch.  Open it and drop down for SECRET 2.2.  Find some The Possesseds and 2 Imps, along with ELITE GUARD 2.1 and a PLASMA RIFLE (SECRET 2.3).  To get out of this area, you'll find a Grate that you can kick open.

This will drop you into the location of the Developed Outdoor area fight, which is now vacant, but some Health may have re-appeared.

Continue retracing your steps by pressing the Call Elevator button on the lower level, and find the Field Drone.  I recommend using it to get the Heat Blast modification for the Plasma Gun.

Now, instead of going forward, turn right into a door that was unlocked when you accessed the Security Station a minute ago.  This is SECRET 2.5. Follow the blood to a duct, crouch, and go through to get to a steamy room you could see into earlier.  SECRET 2.7, ELITE GUARD 2.2, and some armor and health.

Exit the door by interacting with it, to the Industrial Train Depot.

Go through the Yellow Keycard door, and Open the Airlock from the control room in this area.  Take the Assault Rifle if you didn't get it earlier.

Enter the Airlock, then Cycle it to access the red outdoors.

## Mission 2:  Fight 2.7:  Outdoor Fight
This sprawling fight occurs mostly in the lower level of a two-level area.  It's mostly Possessed Soldiers and Imps- lot's of them.  I recommend running through using Heat Blast (watch out for explosive barrels), and using the Chainsaw on the Possessed Security.  Then grab the Berserk Powerup to kill the majority of the remainder.

## Mission 2:  Accessing the Secret after the Outdoor Fight
Follow the uphill path from the entrance to the second floor.  Right as you get onto the second floor, look for a bloody crate.

Jump onto the crate, then jump up and forward onto a duct.  Turn right and go shortly up along the top of the duct.  Turn around and jump onto a higher, shinier duct.

Walk along it, with breathtaking martian views, keeping an eye out for a yellow landing to the right of the duct.

Jump onto the landing - and jump again to a rooftop.

Walk on the roof to an alcove in the building (turn left and go over a pipe, then turn right into a duct), to find SECRET 2.6, COLLECTIBLE 2.1: "Doom Marine Model, Doomguy".

Go back - and on the rooftop look left for a hatch that you can use to drop down into the control room with the in-game waypoint.

## Mission 2:  Realigning the Communication Satellites
There's a corpse whose handprint will grant you access to begin the realignment process.  Interact to achieve this morbid security victory.

Follow waypoints, to go down the elevator down to the next tiny fight.

## Mission 2:  Mini Fight 2.8: Imps after Aligning the Bridge
3 Imps climb up; one more on bridge.

## Mission 2:  Crossing the bridge
Jump across where the surprising Imp jumped up.  Turn right and jump where a green light strip can be seen.

There are symettric platform to the left (away from the base) and right (toward where you came from).  Jump to the right.

Take the platform back toward the building: there should be a suit of armor in front of you.

An automatic door will open, with 2 Possessed Soldiers and 1 Possessed Security.
Toss a grenade back in.  The chainsaw can be a good way to deal with the Shielded guy.

CHECKPOINT.

## Mission 2:  Mini Fight 2.9: VEGA Terminal Entrance
1 Possessed Security and 2 Possessed Soldiers.
(Use a grenade or Heat Blast or a chainsaw.)

## Mission 2:  Fight 2.10: Entranceway / Control Room Area
Three Imps and a few The Possesseds.  In the entrance hallway, there's a door to the right that leads to a Munitions Crate.

There's a assault rifle and CODEX ENTRY "Monsters / Possessed Security" here.

In the control console area is a screen you can use to open the next door.
 
## Mission 2:  Fight 2.11: VEGA Hallway
A Possessed Soldier will run in as soon as the door opens.

Many The Possesseds, 3 Possessed Soldiers, and one Possessed Security.

Often the Possessed Security guards a hall to the left.  It is worth exploring.
After climbing, an Imp will spawn in front of you.  There is ELITE GUARD 2.3 and a Munitions Crate.

## Mission 2:  VEGA Console area
This is a semicircular area with a central room.

But first, climb the crates at left and jump to find SECRET 2.4, COLLECTIBLE 2.2, "Heavy Assault Rifle Model, Bronzeguy".

Enter the central room and watch the cut scene.

I recommend directing the Argent Energy toward your Health.

# Mission 3:  Foundry "Meltdown"

This mission has 4 Gore Nests you need to destroy.
The first two can be destroyed at any time.
The third requires a Yellow Keycard and the fourth requires a Blue Keycard.
Getting the Blue Keycard requires a Yellow Keycard.

Here's a quick description of each Gore Nest:
* Gore Nest 1:  In the area behind the Field Drone
* Gore Nest 2:  In the main area on a damaged platform.
* Gore Nest 3:  Accessed by the Yellow Keycard, in a side-foundry.
* Gore Nest 4:  Accessed by the Blue Keycard, in a locker room area.

The Main Foundry Area is the large open area with molten metal floors and platform-walkways.

Notes on Combat Challenges:
* Three Possessed, One Barrel: the easiest opportunity for this is early on, but you can also do it in the Argent Cell fight.
* Curb Stomp: Gore Nest 2 in the yellow molten Main Foundry Area is the easiest, but there's a lot of random Possessed Soldiers around.  (Unlike Mission 9's "Variety Is the Spice of Death II", Hell Razers do not count for this challenge)
* Quite the Collector: easy with this guide, I hope.

## Mission 3: Mini Fight 3.1: Small Initial Gang
From the entrance area, exit into the Main Foundry Area.
Jump left over a gap in the catwalk.

The following fight does not spawn every time, especially if you die.

To the right, across a bridge, is a Possessed Soldier you can Death-From-Above Glory Kill (as needed for the combat challenge "Curb Stomp") and many possessed you can kill with one barrel (for Combat Challenge #1).

## Mission 3:  Gore Nest 1 (Ante-Room)
Go back, though, through the door and find FIELD DRONE 3.1.
Use it as you wish (I tend to like Assault Rifle's Tactical Scope).
There is also CODEX ENTRY "Environments / Foundry" here.

## Mission 3:  Gore Nest 1: Mini Fight 3.2: Side-Foundry 

Keep going back past some firey doors to a control console.  You can try to unlock the door (you don't have access) or watch a replay to see where the Yellow Keycard Guard has gone.

If you turn so we are facing away from the control console, there are two passages: the entrance on the right, and the left passage has the keycard.

If you enter that passage, you'll see that the catwalk has broken, and you should barely be able to see a deceased guard on the other side, leaning against a non-functional door:  he has your Keycard.

If you try to jump across, you'll land on a platform below.  To your right is a small room with ELITE GUARD 3.1.

Follow the green lights to jump around and get up to a platform at the same height as you started.  The highest platform should say MIXOM.  Look up and right to see a square opening you can jump into:  this is SECRET 3.1, there is a suit of armor here.

Finally, jump to the platform you could see from across the gap.  Interact with the corpse to grab his biometric ID (ie his arm).  Turn around: you can jump the gap easily in this direction - but watch out for an Imp that appears. The flaming door ahead is where the Gore's Nest is located.

Go to the control console (veering left) and use the dude's arm.  Turn left twice to find the Gore's Nest.

## Mission 3: Fight 3.3: Gore Nest 1
This fight takes place in a somewhat dim and dirty one-story area.
But, it's just ~5 Imps and ~3 Hell Razers so it is fairly quick.

## Mission 3: Gore Nest 2
This gore nest is the only one in the Foundry's Main Area.

## Mission 3: Fight: Gore Nest 2
Pre-Fight: A good place to use the heat blast, and a fine place to work on the Curb Stomp combat challenge.  This is a mix of The Possessed, Possessed Soldiers, Imps.

Gather supplies then destroy the Gore Nest.

As suggested by the Gas tank near the Nest, you may wish to use chainsaw here since you might be low on ammo.  Otherwise, just use a mix of weapons; I often mostly use Heat Blast here.  This is a mix of Possessed Soldiers, Imps, and Hell Razers.

## Mission 3: Fight: The Tunnels Above Gore Nest 2
This system of tunnels can be entered any time, except during combat.
But you'll probably want to do it right after Gore Nest 2.

It connects various stories of the Main Foundary Area overlooking Gore Nest 2.

This is more of an exploratory area than a fight, but it is strewn with minor demons.

It is hard to describe all the turns and the 3 entrances to this area,
but it can be explored easily enough.  Just make sure you find:
* CODEX ENTRY "Monsters / Imp" in a dead-end room with some armor
* SECRET 3.4:  To get to this secret area, you'll have to jump up to a nondescript ledge.  Look for a room with a rotating-red ceiling-mounted light, over which is painted "UAC-HAL".  Looking at that, the ledge is slightly higher and to the right of it.  Enter into it, and it'll twist around to get to the secret and the ROCKET LAUNCHER.

There are three access points, all overlooking Gore Nest #2.
Here's a description of each of them:

* Lower Entrance / Gore Nest #2 Access
  * From the vicinity of Gore Nest #2: looking out to the main area, the catwalks on the right should have two stories.  Get to the upper story, and you'll find a small doorway.
  * From the tunnel, look for blood streams and an obvious exit.
* Middle Entrance
  * From the tunnel: look for an observation room; the door it outside the window looking in.
* Upper Entrance / Yellow Keycard Guy Access
  * From the guy: go out to a downward staircase; at its bottom turn into a small door.
  * From Tunnel: look for a green-lit room with 2 large white boxes.  Stand on the box(es) and jump to a yellow patterned ledge.


## Mission 3: Fight: Obtaining the Yellow Keycard
To get here, go out of the Field Drone area, and go straight veering around the Blue Keycard Area.  Before you enter, you may see some Plasma Ammo.

4 Imps, a Possessed Security and two Possessed Soldiers in back are ready to fight you.  The Shielded guy is the biggest problem, and the chainsaw may be the most effective way to deal with him.

Taking the Keycard creates a CHECKPOINT.

## Mission 3: Fight: Getting Away with the Yellow Keycard

Exiting the area triggers the creation of 2 Imps, a Hell Knight, and (down the hall) 2 Possessed Securities.  I usually run to the Field Drone location, lobbing a grenade behind me.  The Hell Knight is the only big problem - in fact, often the other attackers will fight themselves to nothing if you merely wait.

## Mission 3: Fight: Argent Cell
In order to use the Yellow Keycard, you'll have to find a mishmash of demons in a hot foundry area.  The barrels provide an easy way to kill them en masse.

ARGENT CELL 3.1 is found in the corner, in front of a defunct door.

SECRET 3.3 is the classic doom level.  From the yellow keycard area, look back on the walkway you came in on.  There should be a box/crate on its right side.  On the side of that is a Lever, which will open a door in the fight area that enters CLASSIC MAP 3.1 "Doom - Nuclear Plant".

## Mission 3: Using the Yellow Keycard
As you approach the yellow keycard door, a Hell Knight will surprise you.
Entering the door creates a CHECKPOINT, so it is advisable to stock up on ammo, armor and health before entering.

## Mission 3: Fight: Hall after Yellow Keycard, before Gore Nest 3
After picking up whatever supplies from the anteroom,
including CODEX ENTRY, "UAC Personnel / Samuel Hayden",
enter a hall where some repair robots appear to be working on a crate.

Initially there are just two Possessed Soldiers (on the left-hand side)  If you stay near the entrance wall, nobody else will spawn, and it is suggested to kill these guys before charging in.

Then, a Hell Knight, a (few?) Imps, an a few Hell Razers will spawn.  Lobbing a grenade at the barrel can help, but the Hell Knight has to be dealt with.

SECRET 3.5, COLLECTIBLE 3.1, "Plasma Rifle Model, Prototypeguy" can be found in a crate being robotically worked on (climb on top of it then inside).

SECRET 3.2, ELITE GUARD 3.2, can be found by climbing crates at the back of the room.  There should be a chainsaw resting against the crates (initially).

## Mission 3:  Fight: Gore Nest 3
A Possessed Soldier and Possessed Engineer constitute the pre-fight for this Gore Nest.

Destroy the Gore Nest.

A few Imps and a few Hell Razers will spawn, and the finale is a Hell Knight.

## Mission 3:  Finding the Blue Keycard
The map should probably show the Auto-Map - it's on the catwalk area.

Exit through the upper down in this area and you'll immediately run into the Blue Keycard holder (a corpse).  Take the keycard.

At this point, 2 Hell Knights will spawn far away.  First is back at the door you opened with the yellow keycard.  He is quiet and may surprise you.  The second Hell Knight spawns near the field drone at the beginning of the level.  (These will not respawn if you die.)

Drop down to the area where you "found" the Yellow Keycard.
This is a good time to get SECRET 3.6, COLLECTIBLE 3.2, "Possessed Engineer Model, Vaultguy".
Look for the 3 streams of molten metal.  Get onto the walkway in front of them, and look straight down to see a little landing just inches above the molten metal.  Jump onto this platform and look for the doll.

## Mission 3:  Fight: Gore Nest 4
There's no pre-fight: destroy the Gore Nest.

This two level area has a sheltered locker room on the lower floor, where one Imp will spawn immediately but most of the demons (Imps and Possessed Soldiers) spawn upstairs.  Lob grenades or charge in - eventually they'll come down the stairs, but slowly.

It ends with a Hell Knight - since there's Gas, a chainsaw is a good approach.

The upper story has a Health Station.

## Mission 3:  Once all four Gore Nests are destroyed
You may be ambushed by some Imps as you find your way to the waypoint.

The Turbine Room door, which the game will guide you to, is now unlocked.

CHECKPOINT.

## Mission 3:  Fight:  Turbine Room
This fight has two waves, both start with a lot of Imps and Hell Razers.  At the end of the first wave is 1 Hell Knight; the second wave ends with 2 Hell Knights.
The waves are separated by a little earthquake.

After completing the fight, exit at the top of the room, on the opposite side as the entrance.

## Mission 3:  End of Mission
You come into a hall with ELITE GUARD 3.3 propped up on the left side.

Open the Shutters (interact with the screen), to watch a cut-scene with Olivia Pierce.

Immediately after that, an Imp and 2 The Possesseds will spawn. (You could get one more Heat Blast multikill here)

# Mission 4:  Argent Facility "Beginning of the End"
This area will be revisited in Mission 6: Argent Facility (Destroyed), which mostly shares the outdoor areas, but the indoor areas are completely separate.

Notes on Combat Challenges:
* Walk the Path and Bird's Eye View: easy with this walkthrough, hopefully.
* To Be Knighted:  glory kills from above on these guys is pretty hard since they are so tall: unless you
are replaying this with the jump boots, you'll have to jump from higher ground to do this.
The Dazed and Confused rune can be useful to give you more time to figure out how to jump over them - it usually requires jumping from above, unless they are crouched.  Of course, a cheesy way is to replay this mission after you have the Jump Boots which make it substatially easier.
* Bird's Eye View: See Secret 4.1 below

## Mission 4: Introduction
Go forward and Open the Airlock to find yourself in an industrial open-air area:
immediately in front of you is a trash fire and ahead of you is a blocked-off bridge.

Look left.
There should be a octagonal structure with 2 Platforms, a Lower one and an Upper one.
Jump to the Lower Platform.
Now, look left for some green marker lights on the cliff-like rocks.
Jump up a few of them (follow the green marker lights), and on to the Upper Platform.

Now, look for an broken bridge - jump there and cross another small bridge, to your first Rune Challenge, RUNE CHALLENGE 4.1: "Vacuum".  This challenge is not too bad, and the rewards are quite good, so you should do it.  Time is really of the essence on this challenge.

After succeeding at the Rune Challenge, the Rune is NOT automatically equipped, so go to the Rune section of your Dossier and select the Vacuum Rune.

If you want, grab the ammo on the right pathway, but the mission continues to the left.

In front of a closed door, you'll see some Health and Ammo,
and CODEX ENTRY "Environments / Argent Facility".
Less obviously, behind some barrels to the left, is a Classic Doom Level Lever -
the lever is in the dark and hard to see.
Pull it: the "retro" level itself will be easy to see ahead.

## Mission 4: Fight: Gore Hallway
Enter the automated door to a hallway that has been thoroughly decorated with entrails.
Midway down this hall, to your right, is (assuming you pulled the lever above) the SECRET 4.5, CLASSIC MAP 4.1 "Doom - Toxin Refinery".

Continue out the hall to run into 2 Possessed Securities and a bunch of The Possesseds.  Some Imps will spawn soon; once you kill them you'll get more Imps and a Hell Knight.

You can retreat into Hall (and it can be a good way to start the fight, say, with a few Grenades).  But the new monsters will start to spawn behind you, and it may be easier just to stay in the open.

CHECKPOINT.

## Mission 4: Fight: Force-Field Gore Nest #1
Jump over a crude but wide blockade to get to a view of a big glowing rectangular blue force-field.  The gore nest is just behind it.

Looking down, you may see some Imps fighting - they will see you soon enough.  Kill these few Imps, along with the Possessed Engineers and The Possesseds stumbling around.

Destroy the Gore Nest.

You'll have to deal with 2 Hell Knights, 2 Hell Razers, and a bunch of Imps.

CHECKPOINT.

It's probably worth going back to the Blockade you entered from, and look around for a cave (it'll be on the left as you walk toward the Force Field).
The cave has ELITE GUARD 4.1.  There's some ammo (etc) here.

## Mission 4: Fight: Argent Cell
(It might seem logical to destroy the Argent Filter associated with the Gore Nest first, but due to how the Checkpoints work, I suggest doing things in this order)

You can now go and destroy the Argent Filter, but I think it makes sense to first deal with the Argent Cell.

The Argent Cell is in the building on the left side of the force-field when looking at it - on the opposite side of the gore nest from where you entered.  There should be some Health in front of it.

Entering, there will above 5 Imps spawned gradually.

Once they are gone, CHECKPOINT.

Now, find ARGENT CELL 4.1 behind some tanks.  Use it: most players will opt for Health.

## Mission 4: Argent Filter associated with Gore Nest #1
Open the small door on the lower floor near the Gore Nest's old location.
Enter to find a Possessed Engineer and a few The Possesseds.
There is also CODEX ENTRY "Personnel / VEGA".
Make a left to follow the waypoint and interact with the Argent Filter
for a cut scene.

## Mission 4: Under the Force Field (Optional)
There's a small treasure area directly below the big blue force field.
Face it, and go left down a path (which has a Munitions Crate).
Turn right and descend 3 floating Islands of rock to get to a partially open bay door (visible from above).

Inside you'll find Gas, shotgun and plasma ammo, and a little armor.
But most importantly FIELD DRONE 4.1.

## Mission 4: Fight: Tank Gore Nest #2
Near the entrance for the Argent Cell building, find two stacked crates, and a suspended one:  these can be climbed, and from the top of the suspended crate, you can jump to the second floor of this building.

This battlefield is distinguished by a recognizable and large Union Aerospace tank (which you can jump on).

Pre-Fight: 3 Imps run down from above very quickly, be prepared to take care of them.

Fight:  Imps and Hell Razers with 2 Hell Knights.

## Mission 4: Argent Filter associated with Gore Nest #2
Go into the closest door to Gore Nest 2, on its same level - it is somewhat inset - a waypoint should be leading in this general direction.
Inside the building, go along the walkway to a closed green door with the waypoint behind it by 15 meters.
Enter and interact to destroy the Argent Filter #2 and get a CHECKPOINT.

There is also a Plasma Rifle here.

## Mission 4: Rune and Secret
From the small room containing the Argent Filter, turn right to a large floor with large lifts.  You can probably see the glowing green RUNE CHALLENGE 4.2: "Dazed and Confused" on the lift in the opposite corner of the building (from the entrance, look at the opposite corner - the rune is on the structure just to the right of center).

Once done with the rune, look for a large hole that is serviced by a lift (now down).  Jump down there, and into a hallway.  On the left you should see a small block on a larger block, making a natural stairway. (A drone delivers it- wait a few seconds if the blocks aren't climbable - or you might have to go back to the argent filter you destroyed to trigger it)  Climb up, and turn right to see a service walkway which you can jump onto to find SECRET 4.2, COLLECTIBLE 4.1, "Hell Knight Model, UACguy".

## Mission 4: Back Access Walkway (Secrets, Optional)
This lonely walkway is the only dirt path descending from Gore Nest #2 / Union Aerospace Tank.
It provides alternate accesses to a Lab and the icy Gore Nest #3; these are described below.
It has a broken bridge midway.

If you face the Union Aerospace text on the large tank,
go down the dirt walkway to its left.  It is the only dirt walkway descending from this area - it'll turn to a metal grated walkway - then there's a gap you must jump.

Before the metal grated walkway, look to your right for a misty cargo alcove with a lone crate.  Jump on it to get to the second level.

You should find a Munitions Crate here.

A single Imp will pop out if you follow the walkway to its end.

If you stand on the platform at the edge of building, you should see a rectangular duct that runs along the outside of the structure.  Walk on it for a bit until you get to the next alcove: enter to find SECRET 4.3, COLLECTIBLE 4.2, "Rocket Launcher Model, Stealthguy".

Go back to the first alcove, but jump across to a green-lit cliff; jump again to a walkway and kill a few demons (a Possessed Engineer and a few Possesseds).
(This is helpful to get the maximum combat rating)

Finally, go to the end of the walkway (it becomes a catwalk) to a door (entrance to the Icy Area).  Watch out for the Imp!  At the end, go left onto a natural walkway.  This is SECRET 4.4.  There's a Possessed Engineer and a few Possesseds, but most importantly, the SUPER SHOTGUN.

## Mission 4: Lower Area with Elite Guard #3
Start at the Force Field (Gore Nest #1) - when facing the field, go down the path to the left.

You should see an active door, and a series of plateaus that lead to a Munitions Crate.  Immediately to the right of that is a level path that becomes a sidewalk for a building.  Some Possesseds appear here.  At the end of the walkway is ELITE GUARD 4.3.

## Mission 4: Fight: Lab (Optional)
This area has a Health Station, FIELD DRONE 4.2, Gas, and CODEX ENTRY "Monsters / Hell Razer", but isn't necessary to the completion of the Mission.

Field Drone #2 is on the upper level - it can sometimes take a few seconds to fly in once combat is over.

It has two entrances:
* Normal: From the site of Gore Nest #2 / the Union Aerospace Tank, climb a crate to a balcony.  The door enters the middle story of the Lab.
* Sneaky: From the site of Gore Nest #2, walk down a dirt path to an enclosure with some blocks on your right. If you look up, you should see a greenlit ledge to your left, which is your goal.  Climb onto the blocks, at right, then onto a grating looking onto the greenlit cliff.  Jump across and open the door to be in the lower story of the Lab.

The Possessed Guards tend to be in the lower story and entering there catches them more unawares, maybe.

There are also 5? Imps and a bunch of Possesseds and Possessed Engineers.

You'll get a CHECKPOINT when the bad guys are cleared.


## Mission 4:  Fight: Icy Gore Nest #3
There are 3 entrances to this area:
* Lower Entrance: from Gore Nest 2 (the Union Aerospace tank), go down a dirt path to where it becomes a catwalk instead, to the end at a active motion-sensing door.
* Mid-Lower Entrance: This is probably the "main entrance". From the blue force field, go on the path on its left side to a building labelled in large letters "COOLING TOWER".
* Upper Entrance: Access from the long curved exterior walkway with Elite Guard #2.

It matters little.

Prefight: you'll have to deal with 5? Imps and 2? Possessed Soldiers and a 
bunch of The Possesseds.

SECRET 4.1: You can actually use this area at any time.  
It is the through the door on the lowest floor area.
There's the Auto-Map in here, and it'll CHECKPOINT.  Of course, the Auto-Map achieves the "Bird's Eye View" Combat Challenge.

Fight: Once the Gore's Nest is destroyed, 1 Hell Knight spawns immediately along with a wave of Hell Razers and Imps.  There's Gas on the second level (and other supplies) in case you want to chainsaw anyone.

Post-Fight:
Now, go in to destroy the Argent Filter.

There's a Munitions Crate, Gas??, a Health Station, CODEX ENTRY "Monsters / Hell Knight".  Destroy the Argent Filter and go outside for the last battle in this icy area.

## Mission 4:  Fight: Destroying the Icy Argent Filter
This is your introduction to the Summoner.  She will spawn centrally the instant you exit the control booth.  The Rocket Launcher (especially with Lock-On) is a nice approach, as is the Chainsaw, but she can really be killed by any weapon.

Besides her, there are 3? Imps and a Hell Razer, making this an otherwise small fight.

CHECKPOINT.

I recommend leaving the building through the top exit, above the Auto-Map.

You'll be on a walkaround that going alongside the building, a few Possesseds and a Hell Razer will surprise you be spawning in front of you.

At the end of this walkway, find ELITE GUARD 4.2.

## Mission 4: After Destroying the 3 Argent Filters

A new Gore Nest will appear: it's on the upper story and easily visible.
You have to get to it from the building below, which once housed ARgent Filter #2.

Climb the crates, following the waypoint to the upper-story of the huge hangar, right next to Rune #2.

Exit the door toward the waypoint (approx 80m away), stocking up first if necessary and possible.  There should be a Munitions Crate ahead, and to the left is the exit to the Gore Nest.

## Mission 4: Fight: Final Gore Nest
Pre-Fight: there are 2 Possessed Soldiers, a Hell Razer, and an Imp.

Destroy the Nest.

Fight: a Hell Knight and a Summoner are the main act in this fight - there's also a few Imps and Hell Razers.
However, there's a Berserk Powerup, which compensates a lot (in fact, if you have all the Powerups for the Praetor Suit, you can probably kill everything with that single Berserk Powerup).


## Mission 4: Destroy Primary Argent Filter

Enter the building and face left for ELITE GUARD 4.4.

Follow the waypoint to another Argent Filter (looks like the others).
Destroy it, and watch the cut-scene.

Follow the waypoint and Exit the Facility.

# Mission 5: Argent Energy Tower "Argent Tower"
We start the level getting new Jumping abilities, the Jump Boots.
Then we cross a damaged bridge to the Tower itself.

The tower is big and tall - most of the level is spent ascending it.

Notes on Combat Challenges:
* Chiropractor: Imps are a bit scarce in convenient locations.
There are a lot on the bridge, but you'll have to be slightly patient to lure them into Glory Kill range, and even then sometimes they'll be at the back of a platform and it's not possible to get behind them.  (Use the Dazed and Confused Rune whenever you are attempting this challenge).  

There are a number in the fight outside the tower, including 4 near the entrance to the fight (and checkpoint).  There are a few in the first big fight, and there's 4 scattered at the upper regions of the tower.  Finally, there's some in the giant fight at the end of the level.

* Searching High and Low: easy.
* Overkiller: there are 3 Quad Damage Powerups: in the fight just outside the tower, in the fight in the base of the tower, and in the truncated big fight at the end of the mission.  It is quite possible to achieve this in any of those fights: as long as you use the powerup you'll probably be fine.  I recommend Plasma Gun/Heat Blast for bulk killing.

## Mission 5: Fight: Intro to Level, and Revenants

You start on a useless platform, and have to jump left to get to the Maintenance Hangar that VEGA alludes to.
Upon entering the building, look right, and you can see a Revenant eating a corpse.
It soon comes down to attack you.
There are a gaggle of demons on the floor below you, and more will spawn when you drop down to the lower level (as you must to get to the locker room with the needed boots).
In total, there's about 3 Possessed Soldiers, 3 Hell Razers, 3 Possessed Engineers.
(No Imps, unfortunately, as it would help with the Chiropracter challenge.)

## Mission 5: Maintenance Hanger miscellany

Enter the locker room and retrieve the Jump Boots, as well as CODEX ENTRY "Environments / Argent Energy Tower", various Ammo, and a Health Station.

Exiting the locker room, go right (back toward the entrance) and double-jump up onto a platform;
U-turn and look left for another platform to up-jump.
Then down-jump into an enclosed area with a Rune Challenge (which was visible from before through some steamy glass),
a suit of armor, and Gas can.  To exit this area, jump down.

Jump up the same platforms used to access the RUNE CHALLENGE 5.1 "Ammo Boost", but look across the area for a floor you can jump to, under a low-beam; some armor is at the end of the jump.
To the right is a crate and some rockets,
but ignore them for now,
and go left.
There is a platform to jump up on,
and if you look around,
you'll see another green-lit platform above to jump on.
Looking around from the top platform,
you should see a pink-lit short alcove that you can drop into:
there's SECRET 5.1, ARGENT CELL 5.1 here.

Hints on Rune Challenge, "Ammo Boost".
The challenge is to not miss anyone - I find that I jump make 1 1/4 laps around the periphery of the area, looking into the center to shoot any stragglers.

Ammo Boost isn't exactly necessary, but it (and its upgrade) make ammo much more available - especially BFG ammo, once you have the Upgrade and of course the BFG itself.

## Mission 5: Crossing the Bridge, and Secret Guardhouse
Before crossing: make sure you have Argent Cell #1 and Rune Challenge #1.

The bridge starts with a crate and some Rockets.
Use the crates to jump left onto the bridge proper.
Continue along.
You'll jump down to a platform.

At this point, you can expect to be ambushed by ~8 Imps, 2 at a time.
They are all over this gigantic damaged catwalk bridge,
you can kill them, ideally by Glory Killing them from behind,
to work on achieving the Chiropracter Challenge.

From the tunnels, you can and should access FIELD DRONE 5.1 and a SECRET 5.2.  Get on top of either tunnel, and double-jump across to a platform (it has a green light).  Jump left up a series of airy platforms to an enclosed bluish area with 8 The Possessed stumbling about with a Possessed Engineer on the upper deck (near a suit of armor).
Right outside (on a bridge) is a Possessed Security.

Across the bridge is a guard house, which is Secret #2.  Inside is a Hell Knight who will charge at you; and 2 Possessed Soldiers and a Possessed Security who will stay in the shed.  Take them out to find Field Drone #1, some health, CODEX ENTRY "Monsters / Revenant".  Continue along a walkway to some armor.

When done, jump down to a long walkway that goes almost the whole length of the bridge.  There's a long gap torn in the walkway: you'll have to double-jump across (which is slightly hard to backtrack).

## Mission 5: The Far Side of the Bridge
After the destroyed section of the bridge, look down and right to see ELITE GUARD 5.1 (SECRET 5.3) propped up against a wall.  Jump down.  Getting back up is slightly more difficult: jump across the gap to jump nearly vertically up a few ledges, looking for yellow ledges; you'll have to shimmy left at some point.

Note:  You can get back, but it's not necessary and more difficult than jumping forward.

Cut scene.

Enter the next room to find a Health Station, CODEX ENTRY "Monsters / Summoner", and an AUTO-MAP.

## Mission 5: Fight: Tower Exterior
Enter the next area to surprise 2 Imps.  Looking at the Imps, there's some Plasma ammo to your left.  Ahead, the platform has an upper outer story and a lower inner story.  Further ahead, on a higher platform, is a Quad Powerup - it glows purple brightly.

It's fairly easy to get a Neck Glory Kill on an Imp, then grab the Quad Powerup and use Plasma Gun / Heat Blast to kill basically everything.

The monsters who are here or will spawn are many Imps and Hell Razers, and 2 Summoners.

Leave this area through a Maintenance door on the far end.

## Mission 5: Lower Railway (Description and Secret)
As you can probably see by the Map (in the Dossier),
you are at the outside of the tall circular Argent Energy Tower.
Unmanned trains run around it's exterior, and you'll encounter them a few times.

You should see such an unmanned train going right every 5 seconds or so.  Use the Munitions Crate, then follow the next convenient train, and drop into an unused track.  Keep going, and you should see an entrance to a human-sized passageway on your left.

Upon entering the passageway, look back to find ELITE GUARD 5.2.
Continue to find a Health Station and Codex Page "Database / Argent Energy".

At some point, the passage becomes narrower and darker, and we can make a detour to get the Collectible doll.

To get SECRET 5.4, COLLECTIBLE 5.1: "UAC Pistol Model / Orangeguy", re-enter the unused Train corridor at this point (by veering right).  Continuing down the corridor, you'll arrive at an unused, stationary train car.  Get onto it, by double-jumping onto the ledge to your right, then double-jumping onto the train car (don't worry: the upper-train won't hit you).
You should be able to see another dimly-lit ledge near where the upper train cars keep entering.
I found this jump to be quite tricky. but the trick is that you must be facing at the ledge (ie facing perpendicular to it / straight at it), which mean you must jump almost sideways, which in turn makes dodging the train above more difficult.
Once you are on this ledge, turn left and go up (parallel to train), then turn around and jump into the hole that the upper train is entering.
You must keep moving, but when you run out of floor, drop to the left, and you'll find the Model.
Drop down the train area to get back to the Elite Guard, and continue back to where the passage narrows and becomes darker.

OK, continue down this short dingy corridor, and you'll find a Hatch, at left, along with some a rocket launcher.

POINT OF NO RETURN: Dropping down this hatch is irreversible, and a CHECKPOINT is created immediately on hitting the ground.

## Mission 5: Fight: Base of Tower
This fight begins with a cut-scene introducing us (somewhat) to the MANCUBUS.

Use the Rocket Launcher or Gauss Cannon (etc) to damage this guy before running around for a while taking pot-shots at various demons.

Once you damage a lot of demons, look for the Yellow Lift that jams you into a Qad Powerup.  Use Plasma Rifle's Heat Blast to kill a lot of demons.


Post-Fight:  pick up all the Gas and Ammo.

Midway up there's a tricky little secret.  You'll find it after where the central red beam (of Argent Energy) is surrounded by rotating and stridulating metal shields.

Continue up, across a long jump to where the red beam is protected by shutters that periodically open and close.  Look on the map.  You should see two symmetric arms going up.  But one of them has a walkway underneath.  This is SECRET 5.5, COLLECTIBLE 5.2 with "Summoner Model, Purpleguy".
With the In-Flight Mobility Rune, this is a piece of cake, but you don't have that yet, so you'll have to use one of two approaches.
* You can actually jump on the gray tubes that run to the platform, then jump again onto the platform.
* Drop from a platform above, and jump in mid-air onto the duct.

Resume climbing: there's a rotating train that repetitively inserts ducts
into the central beam.  Between when it opens and when it extends the duct,
you can jump up.

## Mission 5: Fight: Midway
A fight involving Possessed Soldiers, Imps, Revenants and a Hell Knight breaks out here.  There's a somewhat tricky-to-get-to Invulnerability Powerup that can help.  It can found be looking for the two protected doors a few stories up from the ground level.  One is your waypoint (it has a suit of armor in front) and the over has the green Invulnerability Powerup.  Use the blue lifts to get onto this high area.

After the lockdown is disengaged, continue up to where the waypoint is.


## Mission 5: Activating the Drones
Use ARGENT CELL 5.2 and the Health Station if needed, and interact with the screen (at waypoint): "Activate Drones".

This will cause two pairs of cars (drones) to transport stuff vertically from this area to a platform above: we'll catch a lift.

Exit the control room and find that there's one pair of drones right in front of you.

Instead, go around to the opposite side of the column where the second pair of drones is (this is also where the Invulnerability Powerup is).
(These drones are illuminated in blue; the drones near the control room are green)
Jump onto a drone and go up:  you'll see a platform at the top, with (if you look carefully) a lever.  Jump to it and actuate the Lever.  Hitch a ride down with the drone.  At the bottom, the drone will plug into a socket; when it disengages, you'll see SECRET 5.7, the CLASSIC MAP 5.1 "Doom - Halls of the Damned" in the back of the socket.

After that, take any drone up to the top and jump up to the highest platform you can.  You'll see another rotating plug train.  When it stops you should be able to jump straight onto it.  When it stops again, follow the plug and some on to a platform on either side.

From this narrow inner circular walkway, you'll see 4 arms ascending to the outer side of the tower.  One of them has a couple of platforms by its end: you'll have to take that one, and jump up a few platforms.

Keep going up, steering clear of the argent beams and taking out 4 Imps.  Eventually you can hitch a ride up on one of the argent transfer things.  From the top, the waypoint is right there: a greenlit door to force open.

## Mission 5: Fight: Upper Office
2 Possessed Solders and a bunch of The Possessed await you inside.

From the office, take the stairs to a Possessed Security, a Hell Knight, and a few more minor demons.  The passage comes to a dead end.

## Mission 5: Ascending to the Top
From the dead end, you can jump across the tracks through a "window".  To your left will be Rune Challenge #2, "Equipment Power".

"Equipment Power" is a pretty easy and fun challenge.  Simply use yourself as bait to lure the Unwilling into barrels that you shoot.  Watch out for Unwilling that spawn behind you though!

After the Rune Challenge, look back across where you jumped the tracks, and notice a higher platform you can jump to.

You come to a pair of elevator shafts.  The first one (on the left) has a Munitions Crate in plain view.  The second one has a Mega-Health down in the shaft.  Drop down to get it, and retrace your steps.

From the Munitions Crate, jump onto an obvious ledge system to another hallway.

Before going on, look at the twin elevator shafts.  Between them, in the hall is a wide brown pillar with orange lettering on it ("UAC E-1" on one side, "U-A 46.2" on the other).   There's a landing in back between the two elevators: ELITE GUARD 5.3 is here.

Continue up the stairs and through the door to another elevator shaft on left, and audio of Olivia.

Carefully peer down the elevator shaft - you'll see an opening about 6 lights down:  jump and hold forward to land in it - this is SECRET 5.6.  Here we acquire the GAUSS CANNON, the most powerful "standard" weapon.  "Open the Turbine" by interacting with the screen, which will open a exit from the shaft.

Take it, and retrace your steps all the way back up to the top of the shaft.
Note there's a Hologram (sometimes known as a Decoy) and a Plasma Gun here.

Now, jump up to the landing at the far side of the shaft and look at the shaft ceiling to see 4 red glowing things - each with a waypoint on it.

Shoot them to cause a car to fall exposing another higher landing you can jump to.

## Mission 5: Pseudo-Fight: Before the Countdown Ends
You could conceivably use this to do some Weapon Upgrade Challenges or
Rune Challenges, but I usually focus on trying to conserve my 200/200 which means perservering for a long time, then taking the Invulnerability Powerup at some point.

Another use is to earn Combat Challenge progress.  If you killed everything else, you should already have the highest Combat rating, but you can get just about a full circle if you fight very aggressively here.

TODO: Timings

# Mission 6:  Kadingir Sanctum "Into the Fire"

Notes on Combat Challenges:
* Dead Man Stalking: these guys can be easy to miss.
* Momentum Swing: fairly easy if you use all the powerups (just don't "save" them for too long).
* Sweep the Leg: there's not a huge number of these guys in convenient locations, and the glory kill is a bit hard to execute anyways.  Don't miss any opportunities!

## Mission 6: Fight: To get the Yellow Skull
Because there are no Checkpoints, this sequence of fights is gathered together.

First, drop down to a plateau with a toxic pond and 3 The Possesseds - target-practice.  There's some armor.  Jumping across to Plasma Ammo, maybe a Gauss Cannon.

Climb up the stairs and kill 3 The Possesseds.

This is one opportunity to get SECRET 6.4: after killing The Possesseds, look up and to your left for a rock ledge you can jump onto, then a sequence of 2 more ledges to get a suit of Armor.

Venturing out will begin the pre-fight; the main fight won't begin until you get near the left edge.

Look down to the next lower platform and you'll see an Imp spawn: you can kill it immediately with a grenade.  Then a Revenant spawns: I usually use the rocket launcher, but whatever works.

Stand on ledge that has a suit of armor on it.  Look down below into the Main Pit Area, and soon you'll see 2 Mancubi lumbering around that you can carefully attack with the Rocket Launcher (preferably with Lock-On modification).

Quickly jump down the Pit area, to trigger two waves: 
* a bunch of Imps and a Hell Razer, ending with a Hell Knight
* a bunch of Imps and a few Hell Razers, ending with 2 Hell Knights

## Mission 6:  Accessing and Using the Yellow Skull
The game's waypoint will lead you to a switch (only accessible once all the above demons are killed).  After actuating the switch, walk across the pit to a newly opened area with armor and the Yellow Skull.

Now, find the Yellow Skull Door, by walking up the path from where the last fight started.  Open the Door to walk in and find CODEX ENTRY "Artifacts / Slayer's Testament #1" and ELITE GUARD 6.1.

Proceed onward to the next fight.

## Mission 6: Fight: 2 Summomer Fight
This fight starts on a plateau overlooking another pit area with T-shaped bridges running atop it.

If you enter but don't move, there are 3 The Possessed you can kill.
Once you walk out toward the middle of the level, 3 Imps spawn.

Once you get to the edge of the plateau is when the bulk of the demons spawn.
On the center of the bridge, a Summoner will spawn.  Lock-On Rocket Launcher is a good way to get her (as suggested by the Weapon Upgrade challenge).
Another Summoner spawns on the left side of the lower area.

2 Hell Knights soon spawn, along with a mess of Hell Razers (etc).

## Mission 6: Getting the Blue Skull
Follow the game's marker to a Chainsaw and Shotgun Ammo.
Continue down a passage to watch a series of islands appear, in the large cavern where the first fight began.

You can jump directly to the nearest island, or jump down and make slightly easier jumps up the islands.  (If you want armor, this is your second chance to get SECRET 6.4: you can see the suit of armor from above: climb the stairs and use some ledges to jump to it)  In either event, a Skull-Switch is at the top of the islands; pressing it, you'll see a gate lift on the lower level.  Jump down there, killing The Possesseds flailing around.

The green mist will teleport you to the next area;
before doing that, head right to pick up supplies and SECRET 6.1, COLLECTIBLE 6.1: "Revenant Model, Astroguy".

Head through the teleporter.

You'll find a Blue Skull.  Upon taking it, a gate will open leading you back to the overlook of the Main Pit Area.

## Mission 6: Fight: Main Pit Area, part 2
Before you can do anything, 4 Imps will spawn up here.

Imps should start spawning below: carefully take them out with grenades or whatever.

A few Cacodaemons will spawn.  Two blasts with the Lock-On Rocket Launcher will kill them, or you can target their eye with the Assault Rifle, or Gauss Cannon works.  You'll also need to keep lobbing grenades to kill the Imps that like to hang out in the area to the right of the base of the long stairs.

At some point, to trigger more demons, you'll have to descend to the floor.  Take the Quad Powerup as needed (if you have 2 Power Upgrades, you'll refresh your health at this point, so it can be best to wait until you are damaged.
There is a wave of Revenants and a Hell Knight, another Cacodaemon, more Revenants, a Mancubus, and a number of Imps.

## Mission 6: Rune Challenge and Using the Blue Skull
POINT OF NO RETURN:  This Rune Challenge is only accessible for a short while.  The protective gates around it are closed before you get the Blue Skull, and after you pass through a holographic ritual taking place in a corridor.  (XXX: is the Rune accessible during the above Fight??)

Accessing RUNE CHALLENGE 6.1 requires jumping onto the central Rock that held the Quad Powerup.  Jump onto the smaller upper island (there are two: jump toward the one closer to the Blue Door?).  Then you should see a man-made (or demon-made) ledge to your right, with a few small Healths.
Jump, and turn around and look up to see a higher island.  Jump to it - then continue the same direction to an upper ledge.  Climb a short ledge to a tunnel leading left to the Savagery Rune Challenge.

After finishing it, go back to the main rock (where the Quad Powerup was), and jump to the "balcony" with the Blue Skull Door.  Interact, and you'll be in a pale green stone hallway: immediately on your right is an alcove containing Gas and a ARGENT CELL 6.1.  Further down, is rockets.

## Mission 6: Fight: Misc Small Fights in the Cliff Area
First up, is 4 Unwilling (good Weapon Upgrade fodder for Super Shotgun or Heat Blast) with a Mancubus, and a second Mancubus that jumps up when the first dies.

Now is not a bad time to use the Invulnerability which is on a lower level near where you exit the tunnel.

Walking along the ledge, some Imps, 2 Lost Souls, a Revenant spawn.
(Kill them while Invulnerable to work on the Momentum Swing challenge)
(Another good strategy here is to retreat and pick them off with the Assault Rifle. Often they'll kill each other)

Island-Jump across to be surprised by 3 Lost Souls, and a Hell Razer (if you haven't completed the Sweep the Leg challenge yet).

Walk through the tunnel behind the Hell Razer, and you'll be on a new cliff, with a fire and ELITE GUARD 6.2.  First, look left and down and you'll see the first Cacodaemon.  There is second one, probably behind that rocky pinnacle.  Lock-On Rocket Launcher is a fool-proof way to deal with these guys.

(Do not forget to visit the Elite Guard)

Detour for SECRET 6.2:  Jump to the Island with the Armor and jump across to a lower ledge.  Turn right, and a Hell Knight will spawn.  Behind him (to the left) is a small cave with the Chaingun (the cave is the secret).  Retrace your steps to the spent Elite Guard across the cavern.

Island-Hop using the upper chain of islands.  At the end of this sequence of 5? Islands is a Skull Switch:  you will see the Iron Gate to the next part of the level raise when you actuate it.

You won't get a CHECKPOINT until everything is cleared (except the Hell Knight)- usually that occurs after the pair of Cacodaemons.

## Mission 6: Fight: Second Pit

Enter to find yourself in yet another large arena centered around a "pit" with bloody floors.  To your left is a balcony from which you can deal with a few demons, most notably 2 Lost Souls.  There's a lot of Hell Razers, Imps, and Revenants, as well as 2 Hell Knights and a Mancubus at the end of the fight (the Mancubus only spawns as you approach the waypoint).

In the pit, there's a tunnel with many small armor and a Haste Powerup.

## Mission 6:  Rune Challenge: "Seek and Destroy"
After the fight a tunnel opens to the RUNE CHALLENGE 6.2.

## Mission 6:  Extracurricular Activities around the second pit
You can continue up the stairs for the main campaign path, or you can return to the levels entrance and look for two small adjacent caves that opened up.

The right-hand cave has a suit of armor and an Automap.

The left-hand cave has a green teleporter to a treasure room of sorts with CODEX ENTRY "Artifacts / Slayer's Testament #2".
You could teleport back, but instead look for the exit corridor and find another CODEX ENTRY "Environments / Kadingir Sanctum" and ELITE GUARD 6.3.

Finish the detour by following the corridor and using the yellow lift to cross the chasm.  If you go straight, then left, you should see the stairs leading down to Rune Challenge #2 (and a suit of armor).

Descend the stairs about halfway (above the decorative gate) and look for a ledge to the left you can jump onto to find SECRET 6.3, COLLECTIBLE 6.2: "Mancubus Model, Redguy".

Back at the top of the stairs, find a FIELD DRONE 6.1 (now's time to get the Gauss Cannon's Siege Mode) and CODEX ENTRY "Artifacts / Doom Marine".

A few stray small armor mark the top of a steep staircase.  Descend it to see a holographic replay of Dr Hayden and some guards.

POINT OF NO RETURN: Once you go through the gate ahead, you will no longer to able to get back to the earlier parts of the level.

Pass through the gate (it'll open for you), into a fight scene.

## Mission 6:  Fight: Hell Barons in Arena with two Subarenas

The fight is already underway between the first Hell Baron and a bunch of the Possessed and 6? Imps.  By far, the Gauss Cannon in Siege Mode is the easiest way to deal with the Hell Baron, then deal with the stragglers however you want.

At some point, a Summoner appears.  I usually use the Rocket Launcher, but Gauss Cannon or even Chainsaw works.

Another Hell Baron and some Imps arrive.

After that's all gone 6? Lost Souls spawn.  It is good to take shelter in the more protected subarena and pick them off with the Assault Rifle or Shotgun or whatever.

Finally, 2 Hell Barons spawn.  I use the Quad Powerup and the Super Shotgun.  If you already used the Quad Powerup, just keep moving and dodging their shots (they move fast, though) and use either the Gauss Cannon (you need to move fast, so no Siege Mode) or Super Shotgun.

## Mission 6:  Onward, after a short Secret Detour

OK, go back to the large main arena from the last fight.  There is a big cave.
Inside the cave (which can be a bit dark) is a lever: an Original Doom Level trigger.  The location of SECRET 6.6, CLASSIC MAP 6.1 "Doom - Slough of Despair" itself is on the lower floor closer to where you entered the arena, or simple walk off the ledge between the two subarenas, and drop down.

Or use the map: it looks quite distinct with a visible arrow drawn into the map in the Dossier.  Once there, the arrow marks the correct switch to press (ie the Left switch).  It accesses a Mega Health Bonus (although crudely rendered, it is just as effective as a modern-looking one).

Go back to the subarena that once held the Quad Powerup, and now should be decorated with a glowing green circular symbol.  When you approach the door, it will open.

## Mission 6: Fight: some small easy fights
First, there's about 6 Unwilling in this corridor. they are useful for Weapon Upgrade Challenges (eg Tactical Scope, Heat Blast, Super Shotgun, Pistol).
And 2 Lost Souls to watch out for.

Instead of charging out island-hopping, turn right, and go up some stairs to overlook a Mancubus and 2 Revenants fighting.  Help them kill each other with a suitable weapon (ie Rocket Launch or Gauss Cannon).

Go ahead and island-hop over to the largest platform which should have some shotgun ammo.  Turning left, 2 Cacodaemons will appear: kill them (using e.g. the rocket launcher).  Go to the edge where the Cacodaemons appeared, and look across the chasm to see that a few islands connect you to another dilapidated staircase across the way.  Make your way over.  The landing hand a few small health, CODEX ENTRY "Monsters / Mancubus" and Gas.

3 Unwilling and a Mancubus guard another tunnel: you should get a Checkpoint here.

Continue up some stairs, to find 4 more Unwilling wandering around some armor:
good target fodder.

A CODEX ENTRY "Artifacts / Slayer's Testament #3" is found.

The last easy fight is about 5 Imps fighting 10 Unwilling.  (I like to work on the Savagery Rune and the Seek and Destroy Rune for this easy fight).

Don't miss ELITE GUARD 6.4 here!  (to the left from the way you entered)

Enter a well-stocked tunnel ending with CODEX ENTRY "UAC Personnel / Olivia Pierce" for a CHECKPOINT preceding the final fight of the mission.

## Mission 6:  Fight: Finale

It comes in unseparated waves:
* 4? Imps and 3? Hell Razers
* 2 Hell Knights
* 4 Revenants
* 3 Mancubi
* 2 Hell Barons and 1 Mancubus

I tend to save the Quad Powerup and for the end; get the Armor on the toplevel (a sometimes overlooked location) early on to make it easier.  Keep on the move and kill quickly.

Walk up the hill to a holographic replay of some sort of ritual with a casket.

Interact with the screen ??? to exit the level.

# Mission 7:  Argent Facility (Destroyed)  "Hell on Mars"

Notes on Combat Challenges:
* Skeet Shot:  Revenants fly into the air periodically to target you,
and so the challenge isn't so much shooting them as killing them (they can take a lot of damage).  Gauss Cannon/Siege Mode will reliably kill them in one hit;
Rocket Launcher/Lock-On will reliably kill them in two hits.  So these are my favorite weapons for this challenge.
* Close Encounters:  there's a fair amount of gas in this level, but it can be easy to forget to use the Chainsaw.  Note that it can be best just to mostly fulfill the challenge on some easier demons, since they take much less fuel.
* Knowledge is Power: easy

## Mission 7: Introduction

Pick up CODEX ENTRY "Monsters / Barons of Hell"

Go ahead and exit to the outdoor walkway, turning right (since left is blocked by fire).

## Mission 7: Fight: One Cacodaemon on Walkway
Be surprised by a Cacodaemon; it's a bit annoying on this narrow walkway- with timing you can get it in one Gauss Siege Cannon, but one have space to dodge it as well.  (You can actually get the drop on it, if you are prepared)

## Mission 7: Getting back into Argent Facility 
At the end of the walkway, turn around and look for a walkway to jump up to.  Next, jump across to a train and follow it to a small landing with two tarp-covered crates.  Behind these crates is a lever for the Original Doom Level.
After actuating the lever, drop down to another walkway/landing with a grated floor, and turn around to see a large octagonal pillar with a large "1" on it.  Behind this pillar is SECRET 7.6, "Classic Level / Doom 2: Underhalls".

Immediately upon exiting this area, turn right, to see a right-dirt floored alcove with some crates.  There is SECRET 7.4, COLLECTIBLE 7.1, "Cacodaemon Model / Rageguy".  There's also some armor and Gas.

Now, jump your way up to the highest accessible walkway.

You'll get a CHECKPOINT shortly before a long double-jump.  It's not really difficult though.  Continue until you are looking into a damaged corridor which crosses the chasm.

Drop into the hallway through the gaping hole in its roof.  Turn around to find an ELITE GUARD 7.1 (along with some armor and shotgun ammo).

Go forward to the computer area.  Find CODEX ENTRY "Environments / Argent Facility".

Interact with the computer for a 48 second cut scene, whose immediate consequence is that you need a yellow keycard.  A marker will take you to the airlock, which has a screen you can interact with.

## Mission 7: Fight: Side Cargo Bay Exterior
While you may not see monsters immediately, they are just to the right:  a Hell Razer, a Possessed Engineer, and 6? The Possessed.  You can take care of many by shooting the barrel.  Expect 2 more Revenants, Imps, Possessed Soldiers, 2 Cacodaemons, and a Hell Knight.

## Mission 7: Fight: Maintenance Exterior
Drop down to another former gore nest location, near the large Union Aerospace tank, on a ground area with lots of fire, to get another small fight with Imps, Hell Razers and a Hell Knight.

There is a Hologram device near some ammo.

Look down into the next area.  This is the area that used to have a blue Force Field, but now just has some fires.  You should see the pale-orange glow of a Berserk Powerup.  Drop down.

## Mission 7: Fight: Main Cargo Bay
First to appear will be 2 Cacodaemons and 1 Imp.  One Cacodaemon often starts very low and can be chainsawed to solve several problems at once.

After that, Imps, 3? Revenants, and a Summoner appear.

In fact, the Berserk may outlast the fight: you can perhaps even you it to kill some stuff in an adjacent area.

## Mission 7: Fight: Main Cargo Bay Adjacent: old platform area
This area is easily skipped.

There's a Hell Knight and a few Imps.

## Mission 7: Fight: Main Cargo Bay Adjacent: through tunnel
This area is easily skipped.

A Hell Knight, a Hell Razer and at least 1 Imp.

This is the area that had the Lever for the classic doom secret in Mission 4.


## Mission 7: Accessing Rune Challenge "In-Flight Mobility"
From the Old Platform Area, there's a blue lift that'll drop you on the rock for this Rune, RUNE CHALLENGE 7.1.

Or, you can jump across from the cargo crates in front of the Security Station Doors.

NOTE: This challenge is frustrating for many people, since it has little margin for error.  However, it is worth the practice, because the Rune is critical for some of the bosses.

From this location, you can drop down SECRET 7.2 which has a Mega Health and ELITE GUARD 7.2.  Equip the In-Flight Mobility Rune (which you just got).  Go to the edge of the rock with the chasm and go to the edge of the rock.  Turn around so that so can drop backward off the rock and face into it.  Walk backward and fell to a cave, jumping forward right as you see it, so that you'll land on the Mega Health.  The Elite Guard is in the shaft behind it.  To get back, jump to a rock with a blue booster.

## Mission 7: Fight: Security Station
To get here, from the Main Cargo Bay, look for a pile of 3 crates to climb on.  The door should have a marker on it (an in-game destination) and there should be Gas here.

Entering, there's even more supplies littered throughout a gory hallway.

Interact with the door to get a short cut-scene introducing us to the Pinky.

The fight begins with 2 Pinkies and at least 1 Possessed Soldier (and a hard-to-count number of The Possessed in the peripheries- most of these get killed by other demons!).

After killing those Pinkies, another wave of 4? Pinkies (etc) is triggered.

After the fight, visit the Auto-Map, and get the CODEX ENTRY "UAC Personnel / Dr Samuel Hayden 2".

There's also a Health Station here.

After triggering and watching a holographic replay, you'll be allowed out the Security Station's second door.

## Mission 7: Fight: Exiting Security Station
Opening the door, you'll see a Pinky:  but there's actually 2 Pinkies.  As well as 2 Revenants, 2 Imps.   You can use the Quad Power-Up but I usually save it for the more tough fight coming up.  Once you kill all these guys you'll get a CHECKPOINT.

There's ELITE GUARD 7.3 on the top level.

Interact with the Munitions Crate in the far corner of the lower-level.
Unfortunately you'll need to re-do this each time you die:  on the positive side, this Munitions Crate refills between most battles.

## Mission 7: Fight: Exiting Security Station and Entering ???
This fight is triggered when you take the stairs across the chasm after killing everyone.

Initially there just a lot of The Possesseds staggering around, but a Revenant, an Imp, and a Cacodaemon are the first wave of guests to this party.

A second wave (somewhat indistinct), is another Revenant, Cacodaemon and a few Imps.

The third wave is different: two Pinkies and a Mancubus.   These guys come out of the hangar ahead of you, and if you time it right, you can take them out with a single satisfying Quad-Damage Siege Cannon on the bridge.

## Mission 7: Fight: Indoor Gore Nest
Enter the building picking up health, Gas, Plasma, and CODEX ENTRY "Monsters / Mancubus 3".

Almost the entire pre-fight can be handled with a single Gauss Cannon Siege Mode shot.
Except you may have to deal with a pernicious Hell Razer, plus a lurking Possessed Security (use the Gauss Cannon on this fool, who hides on the left as you approach the Nest).

Before destroying the Gore Nest:
* Consider taking the Megahealth Powerup on the crate above.
* You'll probably want to use your chainsaw, so find Gas where the Possessed Security hides (to the left as you initially walk toward the Gore Nest).
* The two Pinkies spawn in reliable locations, one near the entrance
* I usually retreat toward the entrance to minimize complications and environmental risks: your mileage may vary.

In addition to 2 Pinkies, a Hell Knight and a few Hell Razers spawn.

The finale is a Hell Baron, who starts on the far side of the room (with the Health Station and chainsaw).  I like to use the chainsaw on it, but the Gauss Cannon/Siege Mode is also quite effective.

## Mission 7: Post-Fight ??? Cleanup

Pickup all you can.

There should be a screen prompting "Reset Crane to Base?" to access near the bridge over the electrically charged floor.  Actuating the Crane will cause a large suspended block to move within jumping range.  Jump onto it, then jump right onto a catwalk.  This is SECRET 7.5: access FIELD DRONE 7.1 at the end of the U-shaped catwalk.  (I tend to choose Chain Gun / Mobile Turret here.)

Exit through the door near the Health Station.

## Mission 7: Accessing Rune Challenge: Armored Offensive
Exit the building and turn left, killing an Imp and Revenant.

Jump across to the right and follow the walkway to the end to find RUNE CHALLENGE 7.2 "Armored Offensive" (which is also SECRET 7.3).

This is a useful Rune for hard fights, since getting more armor is the same as more health, for the most part.

Now, turn around, and run back toward the waypoint.
To the left you'll find a Munitions Crate on a plateau.
Often there are The Possesseds stumbling around and even a Cacodaemon at times.
After killing all that, you should find a CHECKPOINT.

## Mission 7: Fight: Upper Gore Nest

Continue along the ledge, jumping around to the green-lit ledges.
At the top, you'll find an airship with some loot - including CODEX ENTRY "Monsters / Cacodaemon", a Hell Knight, a few Imps, and a bunch of Possessed worshipping the Nest.

Kill the Hell Knight and the Imps, and use the Possesseds for target practice.

When ready, destroy the Gore Nest.

Immediately a Hell Knight will spawn behind you, and some Imps and Hell Razers.

There will be 3 Cacodaemons and 3 Revenants over the course of the battle as well.

Toward the end of the battle, a Mancubus will emerge.

Use the Haste Powerup in the corner whenever you need a boost: this fight isn't too tough.

## Mission 7: Post Upper Gore Nest

ARGENT CELL 7.1:  Looking back the way you came, you should see a plateau at your elevation: it is easy to get to.  Once there, look down at see the Argent Cell: drop down to it and choose your powerup.

Go back to the site of the Gore Nest, and enter the door.

There is a Pinkie Corpse holding the Yellow Guard Corpse.  You can interact with it to get the Keycard.

There's also a secret here.  Look up for a bloody ledge in the ceiling at the left of the room on entry.  Find SECRET 7.1, COLLECTIBLE 7.2, "Baron of Hell Model, Patriotguy".

Return to get the Yellow Keycard, watch the holographic replay, and use the Yellow Door.

Drop down the elevator shaft.  Before exiting the obvious way, turn around and look up to find a square duct: jump into it and find ELITE GUARD 7.4.

Exit the elevator shaft: you should recognize this as the site of an earlier Gore Nest battle.  Make a hairpin turn to the right and go in the Yellow Keycard Door.

## Mission 7: Fight: Tram Access
A few Possessed Soldiers and a number of The Possessed lurk here, useful for some Weapon Upgrade tasks.  When ready, interact with the Tram Console to "Resume Route" to finish the level.

# Mission 8: Advanced Resource Complex "A Brighter Tomorrow"

Notes on Combat Challenges:
* Bottle Opener:  quite easy as there's a lot of The Possesseds wandering around in non-threatening situations
* Double Take:  watch out!  you can't do this in replay if you miss a Rune!
* Hide and Seek: easy

## Mission 8: Introductory Lobby (with small Fight)
Enter a large lobby area, finding a Mancubus killing some The Possesseds.
After killing these, look for a pair of restrooms.  There's a GAS CAN in the main hallway.  (In the Men's Restroom is some armor you can save for later maybe.)

In the Woman's Restroom is a hatch allowing access to a secret area.  Climb onto the sinks and look around for the bloody hatch: jump to it and follow the duct (there's another GAS CAN) to drop into a room (SECRET 8.7) with an Auto-Map and an ELITE GUARD 8.1.  The screen next to the door will open it.

After exiting the Secret Room, you'll enter a Security Area with 6? The Possesseds, a Health Station, an ARGENT CELL 8.1, a Plasma Gun, and a terminal to Release the Safety Lockdown:  do that.

## Mission 8: Fight: Main Lobby
Exiting the security area, there's a handful of The Possessed to dispatch.  Then a Possessed Soldier or two, and finally a Possessed Security and a Hell Knight in the main lobby area.  Keep moving and focus on the meaner demons.

Watch a holographic replay of Dr Hayden and Olivia Pierce arguing about her research.  Meanwhile, pick up CODEX ENTRY "Environments / Advanced Research Complex 2" from the main desk.  When you interact with the panel to open the main building, there will be a Checkpoint, so gather supplies before that - the upcoming fight can be a bit difficult.

## Mission 8:  Fight: Central Area of ARC
The entryway contains 6 Imps worshipping or something.  Use a grenade or whatever you need for weapon or rune upgrades.

Drop down to the lower central area, where you'll find 6-8? The Possesseds worshipping a Gore Nest.  Often, an Imp for above will escape and find you as you are down here: watch out!

My strategy for the start of this fight:  Destroy the Gore Nest;  lob a grenade into the center where Imps are forming in front of you (this tends to be quite effective), do a U-Turn to find 2 Imps to blow away with Super Shotgun.  A Mancubus has formed in the tunnel to your left:  kill it with whatever means, including Chainsaw (there's more fuel in the central area near the Gore Nest's location).

Once the Summoner comes into existence, grab the Berserk Powerup.  In a mad rage you'll likely be able to kill nearly all the remaining demons, but focus on the hard to kill demons just in case, as possible.

## Mission 8: Meeting Dr Hayden

All the bad guys being dispatched, follow the in-game waypoint to Dr Samuel Hayden's office.  

POINT OF NO RETURN: You can't come back here, so if you are missing the Auto-Map or the Elite Guard, get them now.  (??? check that they're even still available post-fight?)

Dr Hayden will resupply you to a large extent (he could really use a Mega Health but whatever).
He will also explain about the "Helix Stone" and Dr Pierce's private lab "across the chasm".
Finally he directs you to the service elevator: classy.

The Dr is in no mood for futher conversation, so take the service elevator.
When the door opens, find CODEX ENTRY "UAC Personnel / Dr Samuel Hayden 3".

## Mission 8: Moxim Service Bay
The olive green area has 4? The Possesseds.
Kill them and find ELITE GUARD 8.2 in this area.

Continue along to get charged by a Possessed Engineer.

## Mission 8: Fight: Gore Nest 1
This fight takes place in a small-ish pit area.  There's a Haste Powerup.

The pre-fight is all Possessed Engineers and is unlikely to be a problem.  Often they materialize rather late anyways. ???

The initially a Cyber-Mancubus appears in front of you; then 2 Mancubi; then another Cyber-Mancubus; along with 6? Imps.

## Mission 8: After Gore Nest 1: Secrets Galore
Go to the marker indicated by the game, and interact with the screen
to "Lower Security Field".

First, there's the RUNE CHALLENGE 8.1 (SECRET 8.8).
Look out onto the big chasm and turn 90 degrees left to find an airlock.  Use it to access Rune Trial "Blood Fueled" (I personally don't use this one).  There also a suit of armor.

Second, there's the Classic Doom Level, SECRET 8.10.  This jump to the lever is pretty tricky.  
Jump across to the immediate platform, and turn left and drop onto the platform below the Gas can.  Turn around and look to the left to see a green light-bar, indicating a platform you can jump to.  Keep going around this rock and jumping up:  the top has a suit of armor on it.  From this top, look directly opposite from the entrance area.
You should see some pipes and a lever at your exact elevation:  you need to jump there.  The trick is that there is an invisible ledge about 12' (4 meters) below the level.  If you land on that it is confusing:  but if you have the In-Flight Mobility Rune you should easily be able to jump from this awkward position to the Lever.
The upgraded In-Flight Mobility Rune helps too (make sure to activate it).

It is also possible to access this switch from the platform near the megahealth described below.

Third, from the Lever, face the piping and jump onto the pipe.  Duck and turn into the cave, and search around into you find SECRET 8.6, COLLECTIBLE 8.1, "Supershotgun Model / Phobosguy"

From there, look out for Lost Souls, and jump around until you get where they suit of armor was (on top of the rock).  From there, jump back toward the entrance, and keep going that direction to find the Classic Doom Level (SECRET 8.10)

Fourth, go, yet again, to the high point where the suit of armor was.  Look for a lower pinnacle and jump there.  From there, it is about a 45-degree right-turn to the Mega Health Powerup, SECRET 8.5.
Once you get this powerup, a Cacodaemon will rise to attack you.

Fifth, from where the Cacodaemon appeared, look for a bay opening.  It contains an ARGENT CELL 8.1, SECRET 8.4.

Finally, look for a hatch that is opening and closing (the in-game waypoint should lead you here).  Jump down onto it for an irreversible Checkpoint.

## Mission 8: Twin Intake Area
Here we are in a pair of air intakes.  If you look around you should see a Field Drone behind a grate: it is actually in the space directly in between the twin intakes.  But it must be accessed from the other side.  Jump onto one of the rectangular panels, and jump onto the only walkway.  You should see a green-lit hatch to jump to.   We want to get to the top of the air intake: we could do it here, but we should access the Field Drone first.

So, walk through the tunnel: an Imp will jump out.

Keep going: you'll get to the other intake.  Turn it off using the panel, and jump down the hatch (just like the one you came up).  You should find a shaft with FIELD DRONE 8.1 in it.

Reverse your steps, and turn the air intake back on.  Step in, and enjoy the ride up!

Climbing up you'll get to a 4-way shaft intersection:  directly in front and in back of you are each of the twin intakes.  The in-game waypoint points you toward BFG Labs Lobby.  The other direction has some armor if you need it.

Proceed toward the in-game waypoint, to a lobby.  This area has TWO green door: the big one directly in front of you with the waypoint, and a smaller door to the left housing SECRET 8.3: ELITE GUARD 8.3.

## Mission 8: Fight:  The BFG Labs Access Hallway

Now, go forward into the ring of labs in the BFG complex.  Get a big gun out and shoot 5 Possessed Soldiers, 2 Possessed Securities, and 1 Cyber-Mancubus.

I usually use a super-shotgun to start, then a mix of rockets and gauss cannon to finish the Cyber-Mancubus.

## Mission 8: Notes on the BFG Labs 
Let's look at the labs on the outside of the hallway-ring.

I'm going to go clockwise (as seen from above) starting at the Yellow Door.

* Yellow Door: find a Torso whose retina will grant you access to the BFG itself
* Bluish Door "Prototype Lab 02".  4 The Possesseds.
* Red-lit Door-ish area: there's a corpse, a Gauss Cannon and some plasma fuel.
* Bluish Door "Prototype Lab 01".  4 The Possesseds.
Once these guys are dead, stand on the machinery and look for an open duct.  SECRET 8.2, COLLECTIBLE 8.2: "Pinky Model: Pinkguy" ???  Follow the duct to drop into a room with a The Possessed, plus CODEX ENTRY "Weapons / BFG-9000".  Go out this door into the main circular hall

That's it: now go to the in-game waypoint and interact with it.

You can probably figure out how to get the BFG from here, but the next section will spare no details.

## Mission 8: Accessing the BFG (Defeating the Security Measure)
Enter the chamber; the alarm will sound, i guess it noticed that the retina was attached to a corpse.  Anyways, jump onto any of the symmetric metal platforms, and watch the crazy security apparatus.

After about 10 seconds, a sequence of lamps will light up and you can to shoot the obvious cells (you need to shoot 4 of the 6 cells).  Do so, and the security system collapses and you can claim the BFG for your arsenal.

Watch the cut-scene.

## Mission 8: Fight: Test The BFG

This fight is designed to be a nice place to use the BFG, for casual players.
But it's probably better to work on all kinds of Weapon Upgrades (Super Shotgun, Gauss Cannon-Siege Mode, Chain Gun-Mobile Turret).

## Mission 8: Before heading out: Rune Challenge "Intimacy is Best"

Watch the holographic replay.

Before going ahead, go right through a newly green-lit door; turn left into a yellow-gold-lit narrow opening to SECREt 8.9, RUNE CHALLENGE 8.2 "Intimacy is Best"

## Mission 8: Gore Nest 2
Now, charge forward into a battle designed to showcase the BFG (and you may as well use it, since you can only store 3 charges.

Prefight: use a few Siege Mode/Gauss Cannons to kill the incoming hordes from the Checkpoint.  After that, coming into this area, 3 Lost Souls will spawn: one straight in front, one left, one right.  After you learn where they spawn they are easy to deal with - and since you have to re-kill them every time you die in this battle, you'll probably learn where they spawn too.

Now, destroy the Gore Nest.  Use the most powerful weapons available.

When you think you are done, it's a bit of a trap.  You have NOT gotten to a Checkpoint until you kill the 2 Hell Barons that follow.

A robotic voice will announce that the demonic threat level is reduced,
but that is just a temporary reprieve: not a Checkpoint.

However, one easy BFG blast will take care of both Hell Barons.

To conclude the level, enter the elevator and "Exit Facility".

# Mission 9: Lazarus Labs "Lazarus"

Notes on Combat Challenges:
* Variety is the Spice of Death II:  note that glory kills on Hell Razers count as well.
* Thread the Needle: use the BFG.  There's two fights shortly after acquiring it that should reliably achieve this.
* Time Well Spent: easy, but also easy to miss.  Make sure you do it before leaving Olivia's back lab.

## Mission 9: Intro
Grab Gas, the CODEX ENTRY "Environments / Lazarus Labs", and recharge your health (you can't get back here).  In the next room you can get the rarely used Siphon Grenade.  Then jump down the chute.

Following the waypoint, you'll remove a corpse-chunk that's blocking the elevator, and 3 Imps will jump out.  Kill them, then use the Munitions Crate.  The non-Secret flow is to jump into the shaft and open a grate.  Instead, look behind the crates behind the Munitions Crate.  There's a duct (SECRET 9.1):  follow it to a Mega Health that'll drop you into the next fight.

## Mission 9: Fight: First Warehouse
A big fight, with many Hell Knights and Revenants.

Kill all these guys, and enter the green-lit doorway.

## Mission 9: More Secrets

Go up some stairs in a red-lit area.  Before continuing on, turn around to see a duct with shotgun ammo.  Jump into the duct, and follow it to a grate, that you must interact with.  Enter SECRET 9.5.  Here is ELITE GUARD 9.1 and CODEX ENTRY "Database / Elite Guard 2".

Now, continue toward the in-game waypoint.  You'll pass through a transparent walkway while Dr Hayden tries to explain things.  There's lots of activity outside.

At the end of this walkway, find FIELD DRONE 9.1 (probably unnecessary if you have used most of the Field Drones up to this point).

You'll find yourself in a curving hallway with 4 The Possesseds, and CODEX ENTRY "Monsters / Cyberdaemon 2".

Continue down the hall to a few Possessed Soldiers and a Hell Knight.

Continue up a short flight of stairs and look for a white hatch in the floor right in front of you.  Interact with it to drop with for SECRET 9.2.  Climb up to find RUNE CHALLENGE 9.1 "Rich Get Richer".

When done, actuate the screen near the door to exit - you'll be back at the hatch.

From the hatch, go into the next room: there should be two large steamy windows in this relatively small area.  Facing the windows (as you come into the room), look right for a torn duct you can climb into.  Drop down into an area with the AUTO-MAP.  Exit through a duct behind the columnar structure in the room.  You'll come to an old school looking panel of lights.  Jump up, and look for a grating to open, to exit back to an early hall.

## Mission 9: Fight: Miscellaneous Hallway Guards
The first room has a few Possessed Securities and many The Possesseds and a couple of Possessed Engineers.

The second room has a CHECKPOINT (used for the next fight) and 4 Possessed Soldiers and a Hell-Razer.  The next room has a bunch of ammo and a Health Station, then drop down the hatch to enter the next fight.

POINT OF NO RETURN:  Once you finish the next fight, you cannot get back to this tunnel area (so make sure you interacts with Rich Get Richer, even if you didn't solve it)

## Mission 9: Fight: Mancubus Operating Room
Many Possessed Securities, The Possessed, Hell Razers, Possessed Solders, 3 Mancubi will spawn.  Toward the end of the fight is 2 Hell Knights.  I like using the Plasma Rifle Heat Wave with the Quad Damage to plow through the bad guys - but your mileage may vary.

After the fight look at the empty mancubus bed at the back of the room, between the two exit doors.  Behind this, is a screen you can actuate to find ELITE GUARD 9.2 in SECRET 9.4.

## Mission 9: Fight: Stone Tablet Exhibit Hall
There's a Munitions Crate in the entrance hallway to this area.  Once you've looted the area, look through the door to see if you're going to be ambushed by a Possessed Soldier right next to the entrance.  Open the door.

This fight begins with 3? Possessed Soldiers (one is close-by and needs to be dealt with urgently) and a large number of The Possesseds (use a grenade or two maybe).  Shortly, 2 Pinkies spawn at the back of the room.

Killing those Pinkies will cause the spawning of 4 more Pinkies and a bevy of Imps.  Use the BFG, Chainsaw, and general evasive maneuvering.

Cheap Strategy:  After killing the Possessed Soldiers, go into the tunnels behind the stone artifacts.  The monsters (most conveniently, the Pinkies) cannot go back there, but Imps can still fireball you.  You may need to chainsaw someone for ammo: the second Pinkie can be a good choice.

Post-Fight:  Going back to the entrance door of the room, and look at the stone tablet to your left.  There is a gap you can use to enter some access tunnels: this is SECRET 9.3.  In the back, find COLLECTIBLE 9.1 "Olivia Pierce Model, Eliteguy".

There's also a Mega-Health you should take before leaving the backstage area.  (Hint: equip Rich Get Richer before taking the health to get one of the Upgrades)

Cheap Strategy for upgrading the Rich get Richer Rune here:
If you don't use the Mega-Health during the fight, then
you can obtain it repetitively after checkpointing.  But you'll have to die in order to reset the checkpoint.  (the cheap strategy is not appealing anymore since a non-dying strategy is available in Titan's Realm.)

Press the screen as indicated by the in-game waypoint.
Enter what looks like an elevator to transfer you to the Lazarus Archives.

## Mission 9: Accessing the Helix Stone
This really just involves interacting with a few screens, in all cases, the in-game waypoint takes you there.

SECRET 9.6, COLLECTIBLE 9.2 "Samuel Hayden Model, Toxicguy" is found in the circular archive room.  Look on the upper floor for a red display screen (there's another similar display in a cyan color: ignore it).  Behind it, a single archive cell's light is red -- all the other lights are yellow.  Interact with this to obtain the doll.

The anteroom to Olivia's Lab holds CODEX ENTRY "UAC Personnel / Olivia Pierce".

After a few screens, you be in Olivia's Private Lab: there's a central hologram of a stone coffin-like thing being guarded.  There's BFG Ammo, a Munitions Crate, an ARGENT CELL 9.1, and a screen to interact with.  On the left is a lone dilapidated computer where Demon Destruction can be "played": just interact with the running computer on the side and exit to get the Combat Challenge.

The final screen is back in the circular archive room: be ready for a fight after Dr Hayden rambles on a while.

## Mission 9: Fight: Circular Archive Room
Be prepared for a endless Imps and a long sequence of Hell Knights.  An Mancubus will spawn; and toward the end, 2? Cacodaemons.

After dispensing with all the demons, a circular stairway drops down from the center of the room.

## Mission 9: Fight: Small fight in Bloody Temple / Pew Area
A few Possessed Securities and a bunch of The Possesseds linger about this gory area.

When cleared, there will be a hologram of Olivia watching over a ritualistic sacrifice.

There's armor behind you as you stand in the entranceway to this area.

## Mission 9: ???
Exit to the right to a blood-strewn corridor with books and candles.

You will get to a circular room with a pit in the center.  Looking in, you can see an Elite Guard, but before that, look right for a Lever to access a Classic Map.

Now, jump in (SECRET 9.7) and get ELITE GUARD 9.3 and SECRET 9.8, CLASSIC MAP 8.1 "Doom - Tower of Babel".

Jump back out, and go to the screen with the waypoint:  "Cycle Hatch".

Do this, and jump onto the platform while is plugging the hole.  Wait for it to lift you up, like an elevator.

Drop down, and keep going and you'll get to a yellow-lit door labeled "Maintenance Only".  Enter for a fight.

## Mission 9: Fight: Server Hall
You catch a few Possessed Securities off-guard, use grenades etc.  There's also a Pinkie ahead of you in the hallway.  And a few more The Possesseds - including some that may surprise you by popping up.

## Mission 9: Server Hall
The hallway become increasingly bloody, and you finally open a door onto a console area.  A hologram with Olivia is playing, and you must interact with a terminal at the waypoint here, the energy refractor control.  It opens the twin doors.

## Mission 9: Fight: Two Level Lounges

Two identical hallways (with bloody skeleton wallpaper), take you to a symmetric 2-level area strewn with Imps, Possessed Soldiers but mostly The Possessed.

Once cleared, from the entry, go to the lounge on the right on the upper-floor.  Look around for a bloody duct at approximately head-height.
It takes you to SECRET 9.9, RUNE CHALLENGE 9.2, "Saving Throw".

There's also ELITE GUARD 9.4. Outside the door, in the non-secret area, is a Munitions Crate.

Then go to the waypoint: a large silo with green concentric circles surrounding the waypoint itself.

## Mission 9: Portal Area Fight
The robotic voice announces demonic presence, but you won't see much.  You have to enter the narrow hallway and go through the teleporter.

Before doing so, equip In-Flight Mobility.  Then enter the teleporter and jump back.  You should land on a shelf instead of falling to the ground.  This is the perfect place to use the BFG to get the Thread The Needle Combat Challenge: it'll make the fight much easier too.

This is a good fight to use the Plasma Gun / Heat Blast - fight everyone - grabbing the Haste Powerup whenever you need health.
Use another BFG if helpful - there's a few lying around.
When the Pinkie or Hell Knights show up, grab the Quad Powerup: it (along with Heat Blast) should be easy work of the remaining heaps of demons.

## Mission 9: Prepare for Boss fight
Follow waypoints, grabbing supplies, along with CODEX ENTRY "Monsters / Cyberdemon".

Dr Hayden explains that this fight will have two parts.  The first part is the easier one.

You will get 6 bonus Weapon Upgrade Points before the fight begins.

## Mission 9: Boss Fight, part 1: Mars
Here's the most notable Cyberdemon moves for the first part:
* the Rockets: he'll launch a volley of horizontal rockets; so long as you keep moving you should be ok.
* the Charge: things will slow as he prepares to charge, so get ready to jump away.
* the Jumpable Laser Shot: this thing does a lot of damage so you really need to jump over it.
* the Charged Laser: this multiple beam laser shoot from his arm.  It starts red and intensifies to whitish-yellow before firing.  You really benefit from the In-Flight Mobility Rune for dodging this - upgraded is better.
* the Mortar Volley: he will launch a bunch of rockets upward; their projected landing spots will be on the ground - find a place in between them to stand.  This attack is combined with a Charge, a Jumpable Laser Shot, or a Changed Laser.
* the Sidejump: he will sometimes take a big jump to the side.  This is his (pretty effective) move against slow Gauss Cannon and BFG enthusiasts:  don't waste your ammo if you detect it.

Recommended Runes: Vacuum, Ammo Boost, In-Flight Mobility.
(notes: Armored Offensive is useless since he doesn't drop armor.  Saving Throw is marginal.  Rich Get Richer is good if you have 100 armor (unlikely).  He stays staggered for a while, so Dazed and Confused isn't really helpful.)

## Mission 9: Boss Fight, part 2: Hell
A small cut-scene transports you to Hell; the Cyberdemon gives you the claw, and is reborn.  You will also be pretty well charged up.

He adds two new attacks to his repetoire:
* the Triple Jumpable Laser Shot.  The first shot will be low; the second high; and the third low.  It just takes practice.  Easy mistake: double-jumping the first laser and getting hit by the second.
* the Double Wall.  He makes a temporary corridor, which'll be combined with a Triple Jumpable Laser Shot or Rockets.  To deal with the Double Wall with Rockets, move in a circular pattern using In-Flight Mobility.

Same Rune Notes apply as above.

Feel free to use all of your BFG ammo.

You will get 2 Weapon Upgrade tokens.

When the fight is over, jump into the red teleporter.

# Mission 10: Titan's Realm "Titan's Realm"

Notes on Combat Challenges:
* Trick Shot:  I don't know why, but using the Rocket Launcher's Lock On mode seems to achieve this reliably.  There are other ways, but I haven't found anything as consistent.
* Atop the Mountain:  there's a number of fights that end with the Hell Baron.  For some reason, i often accidentally kill them instead of staggering them.
You have to jump from higher ground to do this!  This fight where you get the Blue Skull is probably the easiest to get this on, because the Hell Baron starts in a pit.
* Dominator: there's a Berserk Powerup that is your main helper here.

## Mission 10: Introduction
From the walkway, find CODEX ENTRY "Artifacts / Slayer's Testament #4".

## Mission 10: First Fight
Jump far down to a bloody pit to be immediately attacked by 3 Cacodaemons.
As proceed up the stairs to be attacked by another Cacodaemon and a Cyber-Mancubus.

Continue up the hellish path to a yellowish cave guarded by 4 Lost Souls and 2 Cacodaemons.

CHECKPOINT.

Enter this room: you should see a bridge over a pool of toxic sludge.  If you look under the bridge, you can see a Skull Switch.  Actuate it and get out of the sludge.
Facing into the room from the entrance, this caused an alcove to open up on the toxic floor, right next to a green torch.
Inside this alcove is SECRET 10.3.
ELITE GUARD 10.1.  And some armor.

## Mission 10: Fight: Entrance Hallway
Proceed, triggering the creation of some Lost Souls, some Hell Razers and a Pinkie.

Proceed to the right.  When you grab the suit of armor, it'll trigger 2 Hell Knights to instantly appear.  There are also 4 Unwilling in the next room, along with a Skull Switch: press it.

This'll trigger the spawning of a Cyber-Mancubus, which will end this fight.

CHECKPOINT.

Now, pick up loot and search around for the FIELD DRONE 10.1, SECRET 10.2 (it was visible before so it may be on the map).

Proceed to the next fight:  the target will be a gated-off green teleporter, but some demons will distract you en-route.

## Mission 10:  Fight: First Teleporter
Upon entry to this complicated arena, a Cyber-Mancubus will spawn off to your left, and a Mancubus will spawn in the area in front of you.  Polish them off however is convenient.

A gaggle of other daemons come along as well.  A few Imps, few Revenants, 2 Pinkies.

Use the Haste since this is the only fight in this area - use it to work on the Dominator Combat Challenge.

Once you get the CHECKPOINT, approach the Teleporter and the bars will lift.  Enter for an iconic fight.

## Mission 10: Fight: Bloody Cave
Dave's Opening: I usually turn right coming out of the Teleporter, picking up shotgun ammo and a suit of armor.  Look left into a cave before a Yellow Lift: there should be Rockets on the ground and a Quad Powerup in the background.  In a few seconds, a Mancubus will appear right on the rockets:  lob some grenades and go up the stairs right past the Yellow Lift.  You should find a Gas can, and down the hallway, the only Pinkie in this fight.  Kill it and then run and fight as usual.

The finale is 2 Hell Barons.  I often save the Quad Powerup for them (note that 4 Imps spawn when you take the Powerup).

Post Fight: the map may have a doll on it:  SECRET 10.1, COLLECTIBLE 10.1 "BFG-9000 Model / Keenguy".  If not, it's in an alcove of the entrance wall.

Follow the in-game waypoint to the teleporter.  You'll arrive at the Auto-Map, use it.

## Mission 10: Fight: Rectangular Pit
After 6 Lost Souls, deal with 4? Hell Razers and a bunch of Imps.  They can be mostly killed just by shooting barrels.
Use the Rocket Launcher on the Lost Souls to get the Trick Shot award or kill them however you want.


## Mission 10: The Yellow Skull and its Door
Post fight: look for a Yellow Lift near the red door to get you onto the rafters.
Across the way is a yellow pyre:  jump to it for SECRET 10.4, COLLECTIBLE 10.2: "Cyberdemon Model, Silverguy". Jump back.

Now jump over to the landing with the green suit of armor and a wood-grid-patterned door.  It'll open and you can take the Yellow Skull.

But!  It's a trap.  A very easy obvious trap.  I think you'll figure it out.

Continue through the hall (in the direction of the greenish area with the gibbet - the area you haven't been to yet).

A grate will appear to block access to the yellow door.

So, you must go left into a toxic area with a bunch of Unwilling staggering around.  You will see an Invulnerability Powerup here, and at the end of the corridor, an ELITE GUARD 10.2 and a Skull Switch.  Activate the Skull Switch.

## Mission 10: Fight: Toxic Sludge Area
On return, two hatches will open exposing 2 Mancubi.  You can use the Invulnerability on them, or fight more carefully and save it for a minute.

Once they are gone, take the Invulnerability if you haven't and run up the stairs to fight 3 Pinkies.

After that, the Yellow Skull Door is accessible, and a CHECKPOINT.

Before going through the Yellow Door, though, note that another passage has opened and get ARGENT CELL 10.1 and CODEX ENTRY "Monster / Pinky".

## Mission 10: Fight: Pounding Rock Area
The Yellow Skull Door opens to reveal what appears to be a red skull switch, but it's a trap: the floor drops out and suddenly you are fighting a Mancubus, then 2 Revenants and a Hell Knight with some Imps in the background.

At some point, 2 more Mancubi and a Cyber-Mancubus spawn as well.

Note that there's BFG ammo here, so if you are full, feel free to use it!

NOTE: the nearby acid pools allow you to reliably inflict just 1 point of damage, which makes this area very convenient to get the Rich Get Richer Rune upgrade.
In order to do that, do NOT pick up all the armor during the fight, you want about 4-8 stray armor left, at least.

## Mission 10: Pounding Rock Area
When the pounding rock is down, quickly climb onto it.  It'll lift you up to a Skull Switch: press it, and drop down.

Before continuing, to toward the Yellow Door, which is currently gated off.  Look for a small alcove continuing the Classic Doom Map Lever.  Pull it.  The gate to the Yellow Skull Door will open: go that way and go back to the lower Toxic Sludge room (where the Mancubi appeared with the Elite Guard), and you'll find CLASSIC MAP 10.1 "Phobos Anomaly": SECRET 10.5.   TODO:VERIFY: This area also has a Mega-Health.  Go down a corridor and interact with a discolored wall-panel on the right-side: it'll open to reveal the prize.

Go back to the Pounding Rock Area.
Go toward a gated off green teleporter.  Look left to see a large room with 2 Yellow Lifts and a Suit of Armor in the middle.

Go in to what I call the Treasure Room, and pick up some loot and a Blue Skull, a fight is triggered on the way out.

## Mission 10: Fight: Treasure Room
It starts right near the entrance/exit with 3 SPECTRES.  This is quickly followed by some Imps and 4 Lost Souls.  Then 2 Cacodaemons and 3 Mancubi.  Finally, a Hell Baron.

CHECKPOINT.

## Mission 10: Segue

Now, after checking for stray supplies, enter the green teleporter (the bars will disappear as you approach).

You'll be in a fiery yellow lit area.

Grab CODEX ENTRY "Artifacts / Slayer's Testament V".  Turn left for SECRET 10.6: a Mega Health (don't forget Rich Get Richer upgrade).

Continuing along, you'll be back at the Rectangular Pit.

## Mission 10: Fight: Rectangular Pit, Blue Skull Door Fight
A Berserk Powerup has been placed for this fight.
It starts with many Imps and also include a 3 Hell Knights, 2 Summoners, a Mancubus.  It ends with a Hell Baron.

Use the Blue Skull, and find immediately on the floor CODEX ENTRY "UAC Personnel / Olivia Pierce".

Jump into the red teleporter.

# Mission 11: The Necropolis

You find yourself in a central area of this level with the Yellow and Blue Skull doors adjacent.

Notes on Combat Challenges:
* A Pin Pops a Balloon: there are two clear opportunities for this.  Right at the beginning, and after crossing the floating islands with Cacodemons.  Try both, since it can be pretty easy to kill the Mancubus accidentally.  Dazed and Confused Rune can help a little as can ???.
* Two Mouths to Feed: when you cross on the floating islands there's an easy place to get this.  Use Gauss Cannon / Siege Mode or BFG.
* Wait For It:  By kicking the first barrel down the steps you can get 3 there; and the pre-fight in the Square room has 6 Possessed that are easy to get.  There's a number of other chances if you don't die on those scenes (the kills count even if you die!)

## Mission 11: Yellow Skull
To your left at ground level is a teleporter.  Jump into it.

Find CODEX ENTRY, "Monsters / Cyber-Mancubus".

## Mission 11: Fight: Yellow Skull Prefight
Continue along to a barrel at the top of the stairs, if you kick it down you can shoot it to kill some demons, for the Challenge.

Descend the stairs and quickly look back to shoot 2 Lost Souls.  A Mancubus appears at the top of the stairs:  he's a good one to use for the Pin Pops a Balloon Challenge.  If you climb the stairs, 2 more Lost Souls appear.

## Mission 11: Treats
A CODEX ENTRY "Artifacts / Slayer's Testament #6", Gas, and ARGENT CELL 11.1 (the last) are found by continuing down the corridor.

## Mission 11: Fight: Traps
Go back up the stairs to where a gate has opened:  you should see a Skull Switch straight ahead in the next room, but as you approach it, a bunch of Unwilling and a Spectre spawn.

Kill them and actuate the switch, causing 2 Hell Knights to spawn as you return.  Go back down the stairs and kill a Cyber-Mancubus.

CHECKPOINT.

## Mission 11: Fight: Square Arena
This is a square torchlit bloody room with 4 big pillars.

Prefight: there a bunch of Unwilling roaming about and barrels: use them to work on the Wait for It Challenge.  It's your best opportunity.

After pressing the switch, the fight proper begins.

3 Cacodaemons spawn, 2 Hell Razers and some Imps and 2 Spectres in quick succession.
Then 2? Hell Knights and a Summoner.

Grab the Auto-Map, pull the Classic Map Doom Lever, and grab the Yellow Skull.

CLASSIC MAP 11.1 "Doom - House of Pain" is SECRET 11.3.  Go back outside this room and down a hall to an area that looks funky on the map.

This will trigger the teleporter to open, and you can take it to return to the central room you started in.

On the opposite side, a new Teleporter has opened.  This one will get you the Blue Skull.

Go through the teleport for the next fight.

## Mission 11: Fight: Four Platform Arena
Soon upon entering, 2 Mancubi form on 2 of the platforms (two Gauss Cannon Siege Mode blasts will take both of them).  Then 3 Cacodaemons and Imps.  Then some Revenants and a Hell Knight ends this wave.

The gates surrounding the Quad Powerup lift and 4 Revenants spawn, one on each side of the square.  Then 2 Cyber-Mancubi and 2 Mancubi spawn:  the end of the fight.

Take the Blue Skull.  Teleport back to the Central Room.

## Mission 11: Fight: Central Room
Use both Skulls, an interact with the knobs behind each door to trigger the next battle.

3 Imps spawn in reliable location.

2 Pinkies are next.

2 Revenants, a Hell Knight and ? Spectre make up the next wave.

The final wave is 2 Hell Barons.

After the fight, two stair cases open up below the main area (see map), go there and drop into a small hallway with some health and another drop.

## Mission 11: Fight: Cacodaemons in Air
When you stand up from the jump, there will be 3 Cacodaemons lurking around.

Use BFG or (better) Gauss Cannon Siege Mode to get the "Two Mouths to Feed" Challenge.

Jump onto the next platform, which has two large unlit torch/pillars on it.

The next platform has just one torch/pillar.  Peer carefully down from the edge to see a small island.  Sometimes you can catch sight of it from above, but often you cannot, but there is a doll on it.  In-Flight Mobility helps (but is not necessary) to jump down there.  This is SECRET 11.2, COLLECTIBLE 11.1 "Chainsaw Model, Tealguy".

Continue hopping to the cave, where you will be greated by a Mancubus.

Don't forget to get ELITE GUARD 11.1, and there's some armor too.

Continue along to some shotgun ammo and the last FIELD DRONE 11.1.

## Mission 11: Fight: Big Battle In-Progress
Go up the stairs so where some big demons are duking it out: 2 Mancubi, some Revenants, Imps, and a Cacodaemon.  Help them kill eachother and kill the Hell Razers, 2 Cyber-Mancubi and whatever else spawns.  There's a BFG and a Haste Powerup.

You'll want to get in good shape for the next fight.

## Mission 11: Fight: Paired Hallway
The same demons will spawn on each end of this hall.  I'll give total numbers:
* 2 Hell Barons
* 2 Mancubi
* 4 Spectres

There's quite a bit of ammo around, and ELITE GUARD 11.2.

## Mission 11: Fight: Last Non-Boss Fight
Exiting, 2 Cacodaemons will immediately stalk you:  kill them with the rocket launcher: there's ammo around.

Walk down to the treasure trove with a big armor.  This will trigger 2 Mancubi to spawn.  Retreat back to the original area and use Rockets, Gauss Cannon.  Once you kill a Mancubi, 2 Hell Barons will spawn.  Gauss Cannon or BFG is recommended: it won't take long for them to get to you.

Now, you can get an obscure secret, SECRET 11.1.  Look at the large statue / structure that is shaped like the head of a horned screaming demon.  In its forehead, is a glowing pink rune symbol.  Shoot it (with Gauss Cannon or Rocket Launcher, since you need range), and a weird cubic capsule will spit out of it and land next to you.  This is COLLECTIBLE 11.2 "Gauss Cannon Model, Hazmatguy".

Stock up, there are two Boss Fights coming up.

## Mission 11: Boss Fight 1: Hell Guard
This fellow has a force field (the transparent green sphere) that'll protect him from everything, even BFGs, so you must time your shots for when the field is down.  Most of his attacks give you an opening.

His moves:
* Club Attack.  He comes at you, move and aim, since his field is down as he attacks, and right afterward.
* Charged Club Attack.  Similar, but he puts more into it and damages everything is a radius (which briefly flames up).
* Tri-Sphere Attack.  He blows up a glowing yellow sphere, which briefly flashes, then turns almost white, then 3 very damaging shots are launched out.  This can only be attacked after blinking but before shooting.  The good news is that it stuns him for a bigger (Siege or BFG) secondary attack.

Midway through the fight he gains some new tricks:
* Spinning Flaming Spiral.  Avoid the flames:  after this he'll be attackable for an unusually long window.
* Three Drum Waves.  He beats the ground creating a relatively slow moving wave that does a lot of damage.

Toward the end, you may wish to equip Dazed and Confused, since he doesn't stay staggered long, and you have to Glory Kill him.

## Mission 11: Boss Fight 2: The Twin Hell Guards
These guys really act in concert, but it's easier to describe their moves separately.  They lack the force-field, fortunately.

* Bed of Fire.  One runs creating a sequence of long fireballs.  Just jump over them.
* Fire Tornado.  One spins creating a whirlwind of fire.  Avoid.
* Sphere Attack.  Like above but it doesn't flash or trifurcate.  Shoot it right after it finishes inflating to stun him.

When one is stunned, you can often line them up to get double damage out of Siege Mode or BFG.

When they are getting low (20%), switch on Dazed and Confused so that you will have an easier time Glory Killing them.

You will get 2 Weapon Upgrade points for killing these guys.

After killing them, access the Crucible (which looks more like a dagger with a Skull at the top).

# Mission 12: VEGA Central Processing

Notes on Combat Challenges:
* Variety is the Spice of Death III:  there's a lot of Imps, including 4 right soon after entering the building.  Possessed Engineers also can be glory-killed to satisfy this requirement.
* Gore Pinata: Plenty of opportunities for this as well.
* My Teeth are Sharper: you can jump and chainsaw if needed.

## Mission 12: Intro

Enter either door, and in the Console area look for CODEX ENTRY "UAC Personnel / VEGA".

Proceed to open the airlock, and get Gas or Ammo if you want it.  Stop about 115 meters shy of the waypoint.  Look for a green-lit Mainenance Hatch.  Enter it instead of going to the waypoint.

In one shaft here find COLLECTIBLE 12.1 "Hell Guard Model / Quakeguy" (SECRET 12.1) and a BFG ammo in the next shaft.  Drop into the main area from the first shaft, possibly conservatively since there's about 5 Imps in there.

Another Maintenance Door at ground level is followed by a green-lit hatch in the floor.

Drop down to the area with the Security Switches.

## Mission 12: First Switch Fight
Many Imps, Possessed Soldiers, and Revenants spawn when you activate the first switch (the second switch doesn't trigger any spawning).

This multistory area has many pickups, and the area is reused for the next fight.

## Mission 12: Security Shutdown Fight
Flipping the second switch does not cause any new demons to spawn.

But, disabling security does cause 2 Cacodaemons and a Cyber-Mancubus to spawn.
This fight can be won in a single BFG shot if you venture forward about 5 seconds after disabling the security system.

## Mission 12: Cooling Access Fight
Note: you can use the Berserk from the earlier fight.

A few Possessed Securities and 3 Pinkies and a Mancubus scattered across about 4 rooms.
A Health Station and CODEX ENTRY "Monsters / Revenant" are found near eachother.
There also two Elevator Shafts off to the side that have 2 Possessed Soldiers and a BFG ammo.

## Mission 12: Finding the Blue Keycard

Back near the Health Station look for a very bloody side area with entrails hanging from the ceiling and a chainsaw.  Enter and look for a hatch.

Drop down to find a bunch of Possessed Engineers, The Possesseds, and 2 Spectres.

But most importantly, the Blue Keycard.

Go through the Blue Door.

Turn Left to find the Auto Map (if you haven't already), and continue in through another Blue Door.

You'll find a SECRET 12.2, ELITE GUARD 12.2 here, and get surprised by a Revenant.

Behind the crate that the Guard is leaning on is a Lever:  pull it to open access to the classic doom level.  Then go back past the Blue Keycard guy and look for a nested pair of crude circles on the map.  That is SECRET 12.5, CLASSIC MAP 12.1 "Doom - Command Control".

Look down the shaft the Revenant popped out of.  You'll see a Mega Health, drop down, making sure to get it.

You should be standing on a rectangular duct in a very large icy tunnel.

Drop down the other way for SECRET 12.3, COLLECTIBLE 12.2: "Cyber-Mancubus Model, Jungleguy".  Walk along the duct to get back up.  Enter the door to a tunnel.

It'll drop you into a lobby where a holographic guy is blathering about how much energy they use.

Continue on.

## Mission 12: Fight: Coolant Generator Room
Four Switches must be destroy (by shooting) to reroute the energy.
It doesn't seem to matter much what order you go in.

* Switch 1:  2 Cacodaemons and a Summoner spawn, and a long parade of Possessed Soldiers and Hell Razers and a few Imps.
* Switch 2:  A Hell Baron, 2 Pinkies, another Summoner, 4 Lost Souls.
* Switch 3:  Imps, Possessed Soldiers, Hell Razers
* Switch 4:  Nothing new spawns :)

After the Demonic Presence is eliminated, and you have taken all the remaining loot, go to the waypoint and actuate the screen.

Cheesy Strategy:  You can hide behind lowest switch: eventually Pinkies will gang up on you, but then you can take advantage of the Berserk Powerup in the tunnel leading out of the area.  So, the way I usually do the fight is go left past one switch, then go right and jump up across the gap to the second switch.  Use Tactical Scope to take out the first 2 switches from the same vantage.  Then go outside and jump down to the 3rd switch; sometimes a Cyber-Mancubus will spawn there before you jump: either chainsaw him or go over/around.  Destroy the 3rd switch and hide behind it, shooting out with the Gauss Cannon / Siege Mode etc.  At some point, grab the Berserk.  The cool thing about this is that the monsters mostly fight each other.

There's also CODEX ENTRY "Monsters / Cyber-Mancubus" in this room.

Follow VEGA's suggestion to jump down onto a train below to enter the last big battle on Mars.

## Mission 12: Fight: Finale
This takes place in a large depot area, with a few BFG Ammo, Gas cans, and other supplies littered about.

You'll ride the train in and a well-timed BFG can take 2 Cacodaemons and the 2 Hell Barons plus a whole lot of random demons.  Fire it at the 2 Hell Barons, just as the Cacodaemon at left is about to go out of view.

The next wave consists of a few Cyber-Mancubi, 5? Pinkies, and 3? Cacodaemons, along with many Imps.

There are 3 BFG ammo here - so you'll probably want to use it a few times.

## Mission 12: Destroy VEGA
A waypoint leads to a platform that'll carry you up to ???.

But first, look down below for another platform to jump onto.  Jump onto a ledge which should have SECRET 12.4, ELITE GUARD 12.3 on it (as well as a Munitions Crate).

Take the elevator back up to the platform.

Wait on it, until you get to a dramatic platform area.

Disable the Neural Networks on the left and right.
You will get 5 bonus Weapon Upgrade points after this is done.

Then go to the center console.  Pick up CODEX ENTRY "Environments / VEGA Central Processing".  Then interact with the screen to get a cut scene that ends the level.

# Mission 13: Argent D'Nur

Notes on Combat Challenges:
* Hold Still: only the third fight is good for this, so be careful that you have both Barons in sight when you use the BFG.  It would be difficult to use the Gauss Cannon to achieve this.
* Uncharted Territory: follow the guide.
* Big [REDACTED] Gun: you'll probably get this without trying; you probably want to enable Ammo Boost II a lot to get even more BFG ammo.

## Mission 13: Introduction
You start in a large upper courtyard area with loot scattered about.

Eventually, go down to a CHECKPOINT for the fight.

## Mission 13: Fight: Sniper then Berserk
You should start at an overlook, where you can see a Cacodaemon attacking a half dozen Imps.  I usually kill the Cacodaemon (Assault Rifle with Tactical Scope) from afar and save the Imps for up close.

Jump down to the courtyard area below and polish off the Imps who will come to you.  The next wave won't start until you enter the main area.

In short order, 2 Hell Knights and a Summoner appear, followed by 2 Pinkies and many Imps.

I usually use one BFG after lots of demons have spawned, then grab the Berserk Powerup from the very center of the courtyard.

In theory it seems like the "Seek and Destroy" and "Savagery" Runes would may the beserk powerup more effective - I didn't really notice a difference though.

When done, exit via the waypoint and CHECKPOINT near the blue teleporter.

## Mission 13: Fight: Intro Stairs

Before starting, look ahead to an impressively demonic sight of 3 statues feeding some central thing.  (I'm not sure if the 3 beams symbolize the 3 major fights ahead or not)

Descend to the next level where there is usually between 1 and 3 Unwilling staggering around (they will fall down to the next level but they can't get back up, so the exact number varies).

(Because I often seem to need the Mobile Turret upgrade, which involves killing in groups of 4, i often wait to kill them, but the Secret has to be triggered before you drop down to the next area)

Facing out toward the canyon, look for a Skull Switch at the right-side of the level.  Actuate it, then go to the other side of this area and look for some blocks to climb up.  After climbing up, there is a cave just a bit ahead that opened up with Gas and BFG Ammo: SECRET 13.3.

Go back down to the lowest area in this complex with about 8 Unwilling.

Optional:  go through the tunnel to the left.  Once you take any armor at the end of the tunnel a Cacodaemon will materialize directly in front of you, and 2 Imps will appear in the hallway.  A few seconds later a Hell Knight will appear at the far end of the hall (the entrance).  (I usually use Gauss Cannon Siege Mode for the Cacodaemon and the Hell Knight - separately - and super shotgun for the Imps, but there's many options.  Using a chainsaw on the Hell Knight could make  things easy and give you a lot of ammo)

Optional: go the other way (a right turn, if facing the canyon), to a rocky set of stairs leading up to the Auto-Map for this level.

## Mission 13: Fight: Stragglers on the Islands
Jump across the gorge: keep an eye out over the canyon where 2 Lost Souls and then a Cacodaemon will spawn.

Jump down and across the canyon.

Go left and turn around to see the next jump.

2 Cacodaemons will appear, one at at time, after you jump across.

This island has two levels:  climb to the upper level to see the next jump target, relatively far below with ??? ammo.

Continue along to an area with a left and right branch: the waypoint leads left, so instead go right to be surprised by 2 Imps.  There's armor here (etc??)

Go back to the left route, and (I recommend) activate In-Flight Mobility.  Jump around the giant stalactite.

Drop down to hear a demonic voice say "Kill Him".

CHECKPOINT.

## Mission 13: Fight: Wraith Fight 1
You can start by sniping the Imps and Hell Knight, if you can see them from the cliff (you usually can).  This can be a good time to get the Gauss Cannon's Precision Shot upgrade.

Once you go down (irreversibly) into the arena,
this fight is dominated by 6 Pinkies and 2+ Hell Knights and a Cacodaemon.

There's a Mega Health right after the CHECKPOINT for this, so it's quite a good place to start with Rich and Richer with Gauss Cannon / Siege Mode.

There's a Quad-Damage Powerup here as well.

Post Fight: there's a bunch of gear and a near the first Wraith's Soul. (This pattern will continue for the next two fights)

There's are two parallel stairways leading up there: the one on the left has a Skull Switch that you should press.

Go to the waypoint by first jumping to the high platform on the far side of the entrance (it has a BFG ammo on it, initially).  From there, jump into the pale green mouth of a demon statue: it's lit with candles.

Immediately past the mouth, turn right to a passage that only opens after the Skull Switch is pressed: this is SECRET 13.2.  You'll find Gas and BFG Ammo.

Continue down this secret passage, looking for bloodsmears and a lever on the left wall.
As usual, interact with the level to open SECRET 13.5, CLASSIC MAP 13.1 "Doom - Pandemonium".

## Mission 13: Fight: Wraith Fight 2
Again, snipe a Hell Knight and 2 Imps from above, if you like.

This fight starts with a Pinkie but I think there's only 1.  There's tons of Hell Knights, Revenants, Imps, Hell Razers.  And a string of about 4 Cyber-Mancubi that tend to come at the end.  The finale is a Cyber-Mancubi and Hell Baron that spawn at the same time.

There's a Berserk Powerup here.  Don't forget to use the chainsaw if you're low on ammo.

Post Fight: on the way up to the waypoint (a Wraith's Soul), there's a bunch of supplies.  On the left stairs going up, look for a big in the upper half of the stairs that's so big you can walk in under the stairs.  This is SECRET 13.1, COLLECTIBLE 13.1: "Chaingun Model, Cosmoguy".

Continue up to interact with the waypoint, then follow the waypoint to the next fight.

You'll teleport to an area with molten rock.
At you walk up this tunnel, keep an eye out for the third Skull Switch, on the right.
Interact, then walk back toward the entrance to find an newly opened alcove, SECRET 13.4,
containing Meta Health and BFG Ammo (don't forget to activate Rich get Richer before taking the health).

## Mission 13: Fight: Wraith Fight 3
Again, snipe a Hell Knight and an Imp before jumping down, if possible.

This fight is a long sequence of Hell Knights and Pinkies and Imps.
Toward the end a Cyber-Mancubi and finally 2 Hell Barons- you're easiest chance to get the Hold Still Challenge (use the BFG of course).

Post Fight: gather supplies and interact.  Follow the waypoint to the last fight, a boss fight.

## Mission 13: Boss Fight: Spider Mastermind
This is your big battle with demonic Olivia Pierce.

Unlike the other boss fights, this one doesn't have a checkpoint in the middle.

The first phase of the fight, is pretty standard:
* Rocket Volley: a fast sequence of rockets.  Keep moving in one direction to dodge.
* Back-And-Forth Laser: a red laser that swipe one direction low (so you must jump over it) then it swipes back high, so you must crouch under it.

When the demon gets to 50% health, she'll add:
* Toxic Pond:  Pillars sprout up that you must stand on, as the ground will be very damaging to stand up.  The first time, that's all that happens.  Subsequent times, Olivia will concentrate on the pillars, and when she jumps spikes will come out of the pillars, killing you if you are standing on them.   Double jump in the air to avoid this fate.

When she gets to around 10% health, she kind-of goes nuts, shooting many (fairly weak) lasers in all directions, and emitting these weird cubic missiles that do a lot of damage (dodge them).

When she gets to 0% she'll stand up like she's going to attack or something, but she actually flops down and is Glory Killable.  (There's no time limit, she won't recover from being staggered)

You'll get COLLECTIBLE 13.2 "Spider Mastermind Model, Goldguy",
along with 6 Weapon Upgrade points.

After that, watch a cut-scene and the credits.
