# Mission 0:  Pre-UAC

At the beginning of the game, you wake up chained to an operating table
As you break out of your bonds, four demons surround you, your first encounter with *The Possessed*.

Before you have control, you kill one by hand, and grab a piston.

Shoot the remaining three.

Interact with the screen (to the right of the door) and
proceed into the central room with the Praetor Suit.  Interact with it, and
meet Dr Hayden.

### Fight: Mission 0: Glory Kill Tutorial

You will come upon a staggered The Possessed.
After killing it, kill the remaining 4 weaklings.

### Fight: Mission 0: Blue Elevator Chamber

You exit the anteroom to see 8? The Possessed worshipping an Orb.  You can Glory Kill them if you need health or kill them en masse by shooting the barrel.

After destroying the Orb, about 15? Imps will gradually materialize.
Keep moving!
There are two sheltered areas:  the entrance area,
and a control-room overlooking the main chamber.

Grab all stray stuff before entering the elevator *Checkpoint*.

# Mission 1:  UAC

The mission starts with you exciting an elevator, and dropping onto a lower plane.  3 small armor pieces are there; proceed upward to find a Info Entry: ???

As you approach another tall cliff, you can see Imps running off into the horizon: these can be shot but it's not worth the effort.  You can also shoot The Possesseds below, but it's better to use them as walking health bonuses.

### Mission 1, Fight Pre-Blue-Keycard

This is the first real fight of the game.  It occurs on a 2-level dual-figure-eight structure.

To start, kill the possessed soldier at position A, and then shoot barrel B.  But from there, you'll just have to run and shoot for a while.

## Mission 1: Keycard and Secret

After the demonic threat is neutralized, a gate opens up, opposite the enterance location.
However, another gate immediately blocks progress.  Turn right and walk down a tunnel.  Behind a large block is a corpse with a Blue Keycard.

After getting the keycard, stand on the block and look around for a tunnel above you.  You should jump to it, and pick up the Model ???.

Continuing through the tunnel, you'll get to the gate, which will open.

You'll get some ammo, but more importantly, the Frag Grenade, which is very useful, especially once upgraded.

## Mission 1:  Fight: Stray Possessed and Imps

...

After killing those guys, enter the cave to the right (at the top of the incline).  You will find some worshipping Possessed and an Auto-map.  Continue out the cave to find a Praetor Token (an Elite Guard corpse) on the right before jumping down.

## Mission 1:  Fight: Stray Imps

As you drop down the last level of this spit of land, 4 Imps will attack from various directions.

After that, look for the large tank with TRI 9-C printed on it, and enter its lower level... there is a lever through that you should interact with then enter the Classic Doom Level.

## Mission 1: Fight: Classic Doom Level

There are 4 Possessed Soldiers standing on pedestals in here.
I usually use a Frag Grenade to kill the left one, then snipe the right one from just under the pillar.  The remaining two can be taken out one-at-a-time.

If you actuate the switch nearer the entrance, you can get some minor booty.
Mostly, this fight isn't worth the effort.

After this, jump onto the crates at the end of the landing bay, and jump the chasm.

## Mission 1: Across the Chasm

## Mission 1: Fight: Pre Entranceway Area

## Mission 1: Fight: Entrance

# Mission 2:  Resource Operations
## Mission 2:  Fight:  Tiny fight before opening hatch
## Mission 2:  Fight:  Tiny fight in catwalk area with Original Doom Level
## Mission 2:  Fight:  U-shaped catwalk area
## Mission 2:  Fight:  Industrial Train Depot
## Mission 2:  Getting the yellow keycard
Cross the train-tracks on the far-side of the room from your entrance.  You will see a gas canister across the tracks.  Turn left and carefully go through the hatch which automatically opens and closes.  It is an elevator.  When the door opens on the upper level, there should be a large armor.  Take it and go forward.  There should be a train on the left leading back to the Industrial Train Depot, and on the right is a Security Station.

Drop drop and take out the few The Possesseds.

## Mission 2:  Fight: Tiny fight in front of Security Station
A few The Possesseds.

Since you don't have the Yellow Keycard yet, you will have to go down the hall
to a developed outdoor area.

## Mission 2:  Fight: Developed Outdoor Gore Nest
Before destroying the gore nest, take out the 6? The Possesseds possibly using Glory Kills to get more health.  I tend to use the pistol to save ammo.

After destroying the Gore Nest, a large number of Imps and Possessed Soldiers appear, keep moving and shoot the barrels to kill some of them while saving ammo.  Make note of the two supply caches containing ammo+health before starting.

## Mission 2:  Getting the yellow keycard (continued)

On the lower level, Call the Elevator and see a replayed cut-scene of the demon carrying the Yellow Keycard guard.  Enter the elevator and press the button.

On a catwalk area you'll find some health, a field drone, shotgun ammo and the corpse of the Yellow Keycard guard.  I recommend waiting to use the field drone until you have the Plasma Rifle.  Take the Yellow Keycard and watch out!

Go through the hatch then drop down into the Industrial Train Depot, right in front of a Yellow Keycard Door.

But, don't go there yet!  Instead, retrace your earlier steps to the Security Station which you can now access!  Take the supplies and ??? unlock the doors

Continue re-tracing your steps.  In the hallway, on the floor to the right, is a Hatch.  Open it and drop down to find some The Possesseds and 2 Imps, along with an Elite Guard and a Plasma Rifle.  To get out of this area, you'll find a Grate that you can kick open.

This will drop you into the location of the Developed Outdoor area fight, which is now vacant, but some Health may have re-appeared.

Continue retracing your steps by pressing the Call Elevator button on the lower level, and find the Field Drone.  I recommend using it to get the Heat Blast modification for the Plasma Gun.

Continue retracing until you are in the Industrial Train Depot.

Go through the Yellow Keycard door, and Open the Airlock from the control room in this area.  You'll find an Assault Rifle here.

Enter the Airlock, then Cycle it to access the red outdoors.

## Mission 2:  Fight:  Outdoor Fight
This sprawling fight occurs mostly in the lower level of a two-level area.  It's mostly Possessed Soldiers and Imps- lot's of them.  I recommend running through using Heat Blast, and using the Chainsaw on the Shielded Soldier.  Then grab the Beserk Powerup to kill the majority of the remainder.

## Mission 2:  Accessing the Secret after the Outdoor Fight

## Mission 2:  Realigning the ???

## Mission 2:  Fight: Tiny fight after realignment
3 Imps climb up; one more on bridge.

## Mission 2:  Crossing the bridge.
...

## Mission 2:  Fight: Entranceway

## Mission 2:  Fight: Control Room Area
Three Imps and a few The Possesseds.
 
## Mission 2:  Fight: Hallway
Many The Possesseds, 3 Possessed Soldiers, and one Shielded Soldier.

Access the secret by going left - often the Shielded Soldier guards this area.

After climbing, an Imp will spawn in front of you.  There is an Elite Guard and a Munitions Crate.


## Mission 2:  VEGA Console area
This is a semicircular area with a central room.

But first, climb the crates at left and jump to find a Doll (a Secret).

Enter the central room and watch the cut scene.
I recommend directing the Argent Energy toward your Health.

# Mission 3:  Foundry

This mission has 4 Gore Nests you need to destroy.
The first two can be destroyed at any time.
The third requires a Yellow Keycard and the fourth requires a Blue Keycard.

Here's a quick description of each Gore Nest:
* Gore Nest 1:  In the area behind the Field Drone
* Gore Nest 2:  In the main area on a damaged platform.
* Gore Nest 3:  Accessed by the Yellow Keycard, in a side-foundry.
* Gore Nest 4:  Accessed by the Blue Keycard, in a locker room area.

The Main Foundry Area is the large open area with molten metal floors and platform-walkways.

## Mission 3:  Gore Nest 1
From the entrance area, exit into the Main Foundry Area.
Jump left over a gap in the catwalk.  To the right is a Possessed Soldier you can Death-From-Above Glory Kill (as needed for the combat challenge) and many possessed you can kill with one barrel (another Combar Challenge).

Go back, though, through the door and find a Field Drone.
Use it as you wish (I tend to like Assault Rifle's Tactical Scope).

Keep going back past some firey doors to a control console.  You can try to unlock the door (you don't have access) or watch a replay to see where the Yellow Keycard Guard has gone.

If you turn so we are facing away from the control console, there are two passages: the entrance on the right, and the left passage has the keycard.

If you enter that passage, you'll see that the catwalk has broken, and you should see a guard on the other side.

If you try to jump across, you'll land on a platform below.  To your right is a small room with an Elite Guard.

Follow the green light to jump around and get up to a platform at the same height as you started.  The highest platform should say MIXON.  Look around at you should see a square opening you can jump into:  this is a SECRET, there is some armor here.

Finally, jump to the platform you could see from across the gap.  Interact with the corpse to grab his biometric ID (ie his arm).  You can jump the gap easily in this direction.  The flaming door ahead is where the Gore's Nest is located.

Go to the control console and use the dude's arm.  Turn left twice to find the Gore's Nest.

## Mission 3: Fight: Gore Nest 1

## Mission 3: Gore Nest 2
This gore nest is the only one in the Foundry's Main Area.

## Mission 3: Fight: Prefight for Gore Nest 2
A good place to use the heat blast, and a fine place to work on the Curb Stomp combat challenge.  This is a mix of The Possessed, Possessed Soldiers, Imps.

## Mission 3: Fight: Gore Nest 2
As suggested by the gas tank, you may wish to use chainsaw here since you might be low on ammo.  Otherwise, just use a mix of weapons; I often mostly use Heat Blast here.  This is a mix of Possessed Soldiers, Imps, and Hell Razers.

## Mission 3: Fight: Obtaining the Yellow Keycard
To get here, go out of the Field Drone area, and go straight veering around the Blue Keycard Area.  Before you enter, you may see some Plasma Ammo.

4 Imps, a Shielded Soldier and two Possessed Soldiers in back are ready to fight you.  The Shielded guy is the biggest problem, and the chainsaw may be the most effective way to deal with him.

Taking the Keycard creates a Checkpoint.

## Mission 3: Fight: Getting Away with the Yellow Keycard

Exiting the area triggers the creation of 2 Imps, a Hell Knight, and (down the hall) 2 Shielded Soldiers.  I usually run to the Field Drone location, lobbing a grenade behind me.

## Mission 3: Using the Yellow Keycard
As you approach the yellow keycard door, a Hell Knight will surprise you.
Entering the door creates a Checkpoint, so it is advisable to stock up on ammo, armor and health before entering.

## Mission 3: Fight: Hall after Yellow Keycard, before Gore Nest 3
After picking up whatever supplies from the anteroom,
enter a hall where some repair robots appear to be working on a crate.

Initially there are just two Possessed Soldiers (on the left-hand side)  If you stay near the entrance wall, nobody else will spawn, and it is suggested to kill these guys before charging in.

Then, a Hell Knight, a (few?) Imps, an a few Hell Razers will spawn.  Lobbing a grenade at the barrel can help, but the Hell Knight has to be dealt with.

One Secret (a doll) can be found in a crate being worked on (climb on top of it).

Another Secret (an Elite Guard) can be found by climbing crates at the back of the room.

## Mission 3:  Fight: Gore Nest 3

## Mission 3:  Finding the Blue Keycard

## Mission 3:  Fight: Gore Nest 4

## Mission 3:  Once all four Gore Nests are destroyed
The Turbine Room door, which the game will guide you to, is now unlocked.
/PONR/:  Once you enter this area, you can't return to get anything.  Also, you will get a Checkpoint before a big fight, so it is advisable to stock up on supplies before entering.

## Mission 3:  Fight:  Turbine Room
This fight as two waves, both consisting of Imps and Hell Razers (XXX: are there PS?).  At the end of the first wave is 1 Hell Knight; the second wave ends with 2 Hell Knights.

After completing the fight, exit at the top of the room, on the opposite side as the entrance.

## Mission 3:  End of Mission

# Mission 4:  Argent Facility

# Mission 5:  Argent Energy Tower

## Mission 5: Fight: Intro to Level, and Revenants

You start on a useless platform, and have to jump left to get to the Maintenance Hangar that VEGA alludes to.
Upon entering the building, look right, and you can see a Revenant eating a corpse.
It soon comes down to attack you.
There are a gaggle of demons on the floor below you, and more will spawn.
In total, there's about 3 Possessed Soldiers, 3 Hell Razers, 3 Possessed Engineers.
(No Imps, unfortunately, as it would help with the Chiropracter challenge.)

## Mission 5: Maintenance Hanger miscellany

Enter the locker room and retrieve the Jump Boots (as well as a Codex Entry and Shotgun Ammo).

Exiting the locker room, go right and double-jump up onto a platform;
U-turn and look left for another platform to up-jump.
Then down-jump into an enclosed area with a Rune Challenge,
suit of armor, and gas can.  To exit this area, jump down.

Jump up the same platforms used to access the Rune Challenge, but look across the area for a floor you can jump to, under a low-beam; some armor is at the end of the jump.
To the right is a crate and some rockets, but ignore them for now, and go left.
There is a platform to jump up on, and if you look around, you'll see another green-lit platform above to jump on.
Looking around from the top platform, you should see a short alcove that you can jump into:  there's an Argent Cell here.

## Mission 5: Crossing the Bridge, and Secret Guardhouse
...

## Mission 5: The Far Side of the Bridge
Elite Guard below.

Note:  You can get back, but it's not necessary and more difficult than jumping forward.

Cut scene.

## Mission 5: Lower Railway (Description and Secret)
As you can probably see by the Map (in the Dossier),
you are at the outside of the tall circular Argent Energy Tower.
Unmanned trains run around it's exterior, and you'll encounter them a few times.

You should see such an unmanned train going right every 5 seconds or so.  Follow it, and drop into an unused track.  Keep going, and you should see an entrance to a human-sized passageway on your left.

Upon entering the passageway, look back to find an Elite Guard.
Continue to find a Health Station and Codex Page.

At some point, the passage becomes narrower and darker, and we can make a detour to get the Collectible doll.

To get the XXX Model, re-enter the unused Train corridor at this point (by veering right).  Continuing down the corridor, you'll arrive at an unused, stationary train car.  Get onto it, by double-jumping onto the ledge to your right, then double-jumping onto the train car (don't worry: the upper-train won't hit you).
You should be able to see another dimly-lit ledge near where the upper train cars keep entering.
I found this jump to be quite tricky... but the trick is that you must be facing at the ledge (ie facing perpendicular to it / straight at it), which mean you must jump almost sideways, which in turn makes dodging the train above more difficult.
Once you are on this ledge, turn left and go up (parallel to train), then turn around and jump into the hole that the train is entering.
You must keep moving, but when you run out of floor, drop to the left, and you'll find the Model.
Drop down the train area to get back to the Elite Guard, and continue back to where the passage narrows and becomes darker.

OK, continue down this short dingy corridor, and you'll find a Hatch, at left, along with some ammo/weapon (XXX).

/PONR/: Dropping down this hatch is irreversible, and a Checkpoint is created immediately on hitting the ground.

## Mission 5: Ascending to ???

## Mission 5: Pseudo-Fight: Before the Countdown Ends
You could conceivably use this to do some Weapon Upgrade Challenges or
Rune Challenges, but I usually focus on trying to conserve my 200/200 which means perservering for a long time, then taking the Invulnerability Powerup at some point.

TODO: Timings

# Mission 6:  Kadingir Sanctum

## Mission 6: Fight: To get the Yellow Skull
Because there are no Checkpoints, this sequence of fights is gathered together.

First, drop down to a plateau with a toxic pond and 3 The Possesseds - target-practice.  There's some armor.  Jumping across to Plasma Ammo, maybe a Gauss Cannon.

Climb up the stairs and kill 3 The Possesseds.

Venturing out will begin the pre-fight; the main fight won't begin until you get near the left edge.

Look down to the next lower platform and you'll see an Imp spawn: you can kill it immediately with a grenade.  Then a Revenant spawns: I usually use the rocket launcher, but whatever works.

Stand on ledge that has a suit of armor on it.  Look down below into the Main Pit Area, and soon you'll see 2 Mancubi lumbering around that you can carefully attack with the Rocket Launcher (preferably with Lock-On modification).

Quickly jump down the Pit area, to trigger the generation of about 10 Imps, 2 Hell Knights; ... TODO replay for exact info...

## Mission 6:  Accessing and Using the Yellow Skull
The game's waypoint will lead you to a switch (only accessible once all the above demons are killed).  After actuating the switch, walk across the pit to a newly opened area with armor and the Yellow Skull.

Now, find the Yellow Skull Door, by walking up the path from where the last fight started.  Open the Door to walk in and find Slayer Testament ???, and an Elite Guard.

Proceed onward to the next fight.

## Mission 6: Fight: 2 Summomer Fight
This fight starts on a plateau overlooking another pit area with T-shaped bridges running atop it.

If you enter but don't move, there are 3 The Possessed you can kill.
Once you walk out toward the middle of the level, 3 Imps spawn.

Once you get to the edge of the plateau is when the bulk of the demons spawn.
On the center of the bridge, a Summoner will spawn.  Lock-On Rocket Launcher is a good way to get her (as suggested by the Weapon Upgrade challenge).
Another Summoner spawns on the left side of the lower area.

2 Hell Knights soon spawn, along with a mess of Hell Razers (etc???).

## Mission 6: Getting back up to the Start of the Level
Follow the game's marker to a Chainsaw and Shotgun Ammo.
Continue down a passage to watch a series of islands appear, in the large cavern where the first fight began.

You can jump directly to the nearest island, or jump down and make slightly easier jumps up the islands.  In either event, a Skull-Switch is at the top; pressing it, you'll see a gate lift on the lower level.  Jump down there, killing The Possesseds flailing around.

The green mist will teleport you to the next area;
before doing that, head right to pick up supplies and Revenant Model (Astroguy) (a Secret).

Head through the teleporter.

You'll find a Blue Skull.  Upon taking it, a gate will open leading you back to the overlook of the Main Pit Area.

## Mission 6: Fight: Main Pit Area, part 2
Before you can do anything, 3 Imps will spawn up here.
